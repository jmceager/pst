Inclusion of these customers' usage presents a more accurate representation of the unaccounted for percentage and is in line with proposed PHMSA modifications to this calculation. -Beginning in 2017, New York State's Public Service Commission revised the methodology and criteria for Con Edison's reporting of ""One Call Tickets"" (Excavation Tickets). The revised methodology results in a smaller geographic area being captured by Con Edison for reporting purposes and a concomitant decline in the reported ""Number of Excavation Tickets"" as compared to 2016 and prior years.",Melissa Rodriguez,Sr Analyst,(917) 608-2184,(000) 000-0000,rodriguezme@coned.com,INITIAL,3/14/2024,3/14/2024,7100.1-1 (Rev. 06-2023)

This resulted in Total Miles of Main CY2023 being 7.6 miles less than Total Miles CY2022. 3) In CY2023, gas services in our GIS mapping system and service information within our GIS were refined which resulted in improved representation of services in our GIS system. 4) Part B Table 3: Other Service Material = Galvanized Steel(14,333), Malleable Iron(1), and Unknown Material(1,480); for a Total Other Service Material (Total of All Sizes and Unkn.
