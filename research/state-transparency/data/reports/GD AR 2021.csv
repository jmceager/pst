This explains why all of these bare steel counts have been significantly reduced or eliminated (for CP-protected and CP-unprotected) and moved into the coated categories. Section B.3 and B.4 reflect the combined impacts of: (1) another serviceline data clean-up initiative, as well as (2) a related change of approach in the serviceline counting method for the DOT Report. The serviceline data clean-up initiative here in focus was a project to digitize service lines in GIS, based on active meter locations, where servicelines are known to exist and not already digitized but have minimal installation records. The related change in counting method was a shift to reporting service lines entirely out of GIS using known and verified assets. The combined impact of these on serviceline reporting explains the increase in ""other"" material type, increase in PE services less than 1"", changes in the size ranges, increase in average service length, as well as the increase in older decades-of-installation from the 2020 DOT report to the 2021 DOT report.",Barbara Varanauski,VP Gas Engineering & Sys.

Inclusion of these customers' usage presents a more accurate representation of the unaccounted for percentage and is inline with proposed PHMSA modifications to this calculation. - Beginning in 2017, New York State's Public Service Commission revised the methodology and criteria for Con Edison's reporting of ""One Call Tickets""(Excavation Tickets). The revised methodology results in a smaller geographic area being captured by Con Edison for reporting purposes and a concomitant decline in the reported ""Number of Excavation Tickets"" as compared to 2016 and prior years.",Melissa Rodriguez,,(917) 608-2184,(000) 000-0000,rodriguezme@coned.com,SUPPLEMENTAL,3/15/2022,3/24/2023,7100.1-1 (Rev. 05-2021)

Leak Backlog Reduction - As the pending leak backlog was brought down in 2021, many of these leaks were G2/G3 cast iron main leaks on bell joints and service tees, which fall under Material/Weld, which increased the numbers.",Michael Nee,Staff Engineer,(412)432-8015,,michael.nee@dteenergy.com,INITIAL,3/13/2022,3/13/2022,7100.1-1 (Rev. 05-2021)
