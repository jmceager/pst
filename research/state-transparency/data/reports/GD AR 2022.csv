Inclusion of these customers' usage presents a more accurate representation of the unaccounted for percentage and is inline with proposed PHMSA modifications to this calculation. - Beginning in 2017, New York State's Public Service Commission revised the methodology and criteria for Con Edison's reporting of ""One Call Tickets"" (Excavation Tickets). The revised methodology results in a smaller geographic area being captured by Con Edison for reporting purposes and a concomitant decline in the reported ""Number of Excavation Tickets"" as compared to 2016 and prior years.",Melissa Rodriguez,,(917) 608-2184,(000) 000-0000,rodriguezme@coned.com,INITIAL,3/15/2023,3/15/2023,7100.1-1 (Rev. 05-2021)

The City recently hired a new City manager, as well as a new Energy Services Director, both of whom are making this process a priority.

Tri-County merged with City of Greensboro and Union Point. A 100% system-wide survey was completed in 2022 for the newly formed Authority. Based on the results of this survey, this report reflects the total mileage of main and number of services system-wide. There was a discrepancy of 157 services and 3.29 miles of main between the system-wide survey and the 2021 7100 reports from the three separate systems, which has been adjusted in this report. Also, due to the lack of records, the mains and services reported by decade of installation have now been adjusted to show all pipe previously reported as pre-1990 in the ""unknown"" decade. The LAUF has also been re-calculated to ensure that the 3 separate systems' data was combined correctly prior to the merger, which occurred during the year. There were evidently some inaccuracies in the LAUF calculation with the mid-year merger, but the current year (7/2022 - 6/2023) LAUF is tracking within the +/- 2% tolerance.",Lori Lamberth,Senior Compliance Analyst,(678) 725-6303,(000) 000-0000,llamberth@gasauthority.com,SUPPLEMENTAL,3/14/2023,10/17/2023,7100.1-1 (Rev. 05-2021)
