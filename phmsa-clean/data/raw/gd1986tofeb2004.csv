THE TOTAL MARKET VALUE OF THE THREE BUILDINGS WAS PLACED AT $310,000.00 BASED ONASSESSED VALUATIONS ON RECORD AT THE COLUMBIA COUNTY COURTHOUSE. VALUE OF THE CONTENTS IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME. THE FIRE WAS REPORTED BY A CLEANING LADY, WORKING IN A RESTAURANT APPROXIMATELY ONE BLOCK AWAY WHO NOTICED FLAMES SHOOTING UP FROM THE REAR OF PAUL'S CHILDREN'S SHOP LOCATED AT 130 WEST FRONT STREET, BERWICK. THE FIRE ALARM WAS TURNED IN AT 4:05 A.M. SGT. ROGER NUNKESTER, OF THE BERWICKPOLICE DEPARTMENT, BEING THE FIRST ONE ON THE SCENE, ATTEMPTED TO EXTINGUISH THE FLAMES WHICH CONSISTED OF A PILE OF BURNING TRASH WHICH WAS ENGULFING A GAS METER AT THE REAR OF THE BUILDING AT 130 WEST FRONT STREET. THE FIRE SIMPLY IGNITED. AT 4:09 A.M., CENTRAL DISPATCH OF THE PENNSYLVANIA GAS & WATER COMPANY WAS NOTIFIED THAT THERE WAS A GAS METER ON FIRE ON WEST FRONT STREET. AT 4:10 A.M., JAYSMITH, SERVICEPERSON, WAS DISPATCHED AND ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AT 4:26 A.M. AT THIS TIME THERE WAS NO FIRE AT OR AROUND THE METER. MR. SMITH FOUND THAT THE FIREMEN HAD SHUT THE GAS OFF AT THE 3/4"" GAS COCK LOCATED ON THE METER RISER. AFTER MAKING SURE THERE WAS NO LIVE GAS IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA, HE STOOD BY TO ASSIST IF NEEDED. THE GAS FACILITIES SERVICING PAUL'S CHILDREN'S SHOP CONSISTED OF: - 1/2 "" PLASTIC GAS SERVICE CONNECTED TO A 6"" STEEL GAS MAIN AT 45 P.S.I.G.

IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT THE INSULATED 3/4"" UNION LOCATED ON THE RISER WAS BADLY BURNED AND THE INSULATED GASKET WAS DESTROYED ALLOWING 45 P.S.I. GAS TO ESCAPE INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE FIRE ORIGINATED FROM THE BOXES AND TRASH THAT WAS PILED ON AND AROUND THE GAS FACILITIES ALLEGEDLY IGNITED BY THE SUSPECTED ARSONIST. THE FIRE FROM THE TRASH IN TURN BURNED OUT THE GASKET IN THE METER AND THE GASKET AND DIAPHRAGM IN THEREGULATOR ALLOWING GAS TO ESCAPE AND IGNITE. THE RUBBER INSULATION BURNED AWAY IN THE 3/4"" UNION ON THE RISER LOCATED AHEAD OF THE REGULATOR ALLOWING 45 P.S.I.GAS TO IGNITE AND CREATE A BLOW TORCH AFFECT WHICH BURNED THROUGH A SECTION OF PLYWOOD USED TO BOARD UP A WINDOW LOCATED ABOVE THE METER SET.

AN INITIAL FLAME-PACK SURVEY OF THE BLAST SITE INDICATED GAS AROUND THE BUILDING SLAB. A FLAME PACK OF THE GAS LINE ALONG THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING INDICATED ONE LEAK NEAR THE EAST EDGE OF THE EDGE OF THE PROPERTY. A 2-INCH PLASTIC LINE THAT SERVED THE AREA WAS CLAMPED OF NEAR THE NORTHEAST EDGE OF THE PROPERTY,  APPROXIMATELY 300 FEET AWAY. STATE OF OK FIRE MARSHALL AGENT SHELLY PHILLIPS AND A GROUPOF DEFERAL ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, AND FIREARMS DIVISION (ATF) EMPLOYEES LED BY LOU JOBSON, ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AROUND 0830 HOURS. THEIR INITIAL REACTION WASA ""CLASSIC DYNAMITE CASE.""  THE PRESENCE OF GAS WAS ORIGINALLYY THOUGHT TO BE THE RESULT OF THE BLAST. LOU JOHNSON OF THE ATF DIVISION APPARENTLY SSUMEDJURISDICTION OF THE INVESTIGATION ALONG WITH FIRE MARSHALL AGENT SHELLY PHILLIPS BECAUSE THEY ASSUMED IT WAS A DELIBERATELY CAUSED EXPLOSIVE USED. THE DOZER ARRIVED AND STARTED CLEARING THE SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 1000 HOURS. OKLAHOMA NATURAL GAS EMPLOYEES MET WITH DEAN WISE AND SHELLY PHILLIPS AND WERE UPDATED ON THE SITUATION. GAS WAS STILL NOT BEING CONSIDERED AS THE SOURCE OF EXPLOSION AT THIS TIME. OKLAHOMA NATURAL GAS CONTINUED TO TAKE CGI READINGS AROUNT THE SITE. THE READINGS VARIED FROM 20 PERCENT TO 100 PERCENT GAS AROUND THE FILL AREA. WE SUSPECTED THE GAS WAS FROM SOME OTHER SOURCE DUE TO THE IDISTANCE FROM OUR GAS LINE. AT ATF TEAM COMPLETED CLEARING THE BUILDING SLAB AND FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF HIGH EXPLOSIVES. AT THIS TIME LOU JOBSONN OF THE ATF TEAM MADE A PRELIMIANARY REPORT RULING OUT THE USE OF EXPLOSIVES IN THEE BLAST AND INDICATED THE BLAST WAS PROBABLY DUE TO NATURAL GAS FROM AN UNKNOWNSOURCE. THE OKLAHOMA STATE FIRE MARSHAL REQUESTED A CHECK OF ODORANT LEVEL IN OUR GAS LINE. AN ODOR OF MERCAPTAN AT THE BLAST SITE WAS NOT APPARENT EVEN THOUGH WE WERE PICKING UP VOLUME GAS READINGS ALL AROUND THE AREA. AN ODORANT LEVEL IN OUR GAS LINE. AN ODOR OF MERCAPTAN AT THE BLAST SITE WAS NOT APPARENT EVEN THOUGH WE WERE PICKING UP VOLUME GAS READINGS ALL AROUND THE AREA. AN ODORANT TEST USING A HEATH ODOR TESTER, MODEL 5637, WAS RUN AT A GAS METER NEXT TO THE BLAST SITE; THE  ODORANT LEVEL INDICATED WAS 0.40 PERCENT OF GAS WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO BE NORMAL. ONE OF THE REASONS GAS HAD NOT BEEN SUPPECTED AS THE PREMARY SOURCE OF THE EXPLOSION WAS A LACK OF AN IGNITION SOURC"

THE EXPLOSION DESTROYED THE BUILDING AND CAUSED SEVERE DAMAGE TO THE ADJACENT BUILDINGS; HOWEVER, THERE WERE ONLY MINOR INJURIES TO THREE PEOPLE IN THE VICINITY.  THE NEW ORLEANS FIRE DEPARTMENT (NOFD) NOTIFIED THE GAS DISPATCHER AT NEW ORLEANS PUBLIC SERICE (NOPSI) AT 12:33 AM.  A GAS SERVICEMAN WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED AND ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT APPROXIMATELT 12:45AM. UPON ARRIVAL THE SERVICEMAN NOTED A SMALL LEAK AT THE INSULATED UNION IN THE SERVICE RISER.  THE SERVICE RISER WAS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE BUILDING NEAR THE GROUND APPROXIMATELY THREE INCHES FROM THE BUILDING FOUNDATION.  THE LEAK WAS OBVIOUSLY CAUSED BY THE EXPLOSION WHICH BENT THE SERVICE RISER THEREBY CRACKING THE INSULATOR.  THE RISER WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED AND THE SERVICE WAS CAPPED-OFF.  THE ADJACENT AREA WAS THEN CHECKED FOR THE PRESENCE OF NATURAL GAS WITH A COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR (CGI) AND NO MEASURABLE QUANTITY OF GAS WAS FOUND.  AT THAT TIME THE AREA WAS DEEMED SAFE.  NOPSI RECORDS INDICATE THAT THE RESIDENCE IS SERVED BY ONE (1) GAS SERVICE WITH A THREE (3) METER SET AND THREE(3) METER SHUT-OFF VALVES WHICH, ACCORDING TO MOPSI RECORDS, WERE OFFAND LOCKED AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION.  HOWEVER, THE SERVICEMAN NOTED THATTHE  METER VALVE TO APARTMENT A WAS NOT LOCKED AND THE VALVE WAS IN THE  OPEN POSITION.  THE READING ON THE METER IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE EXPLOSION WAS 0342.  NOPSI RECORDS INDICATE THAT THE READING TAKEN WHEN THE METER WAS SHUT (I.E. VALVE TURNED-OFF AND LOCKED) WAS 0331.  THEREFORE, AN UNAUTHORIZED CONSUMPTION OF APPROXIMATELY 11 CCF WAS INDICATED.  JOSEPH F. RICKS JR., ANOPSI REPRESENTATIVE, INVESTIGATED THE INCIDENT AND FOUND THAT THE EXPLOSIONAPPARENTLY RESULTED WHEN NATURAL GAS ACCUMULATED IN APARTMENT A FROM AN OPENOR FAILED CUSTOMER FUEL LINE AND WAS IGNITED.

A HOUSE EXPLOSION AND FIRE WAS REPORTED AT THE CORNER OF WEST SEVIER AVENUE AND BROAD STREET IN KINGSPORT, TENNESSEE.  THE SITE WAS LATER IDENTIFIED AS 110 WEST SEVIER AVENUE, ANUNOCCUPIED TWO-STORY, FRAME STRUCTURE.  IT WAS BORDERED BY A CHURCH, RESIDENCES OF SIMILAR STRUCTURE, AND PARKING LOTS.  MANY BUILDINGS IN THE AREA SURROUNDING THE SITE HAVE REPORTED DAMAGE WHICH INCLUDE BROKEN WINDOWS, DAMAGED ROOFS AND PLASTER WALLS, AND SCRATCHED FURNITURE.  THERE ARE ALSO SOME REPORTS OF PERSONAL INJURY, PRIMARILY CAUSED BY THE GLASS FROM THE BROKEN WINDOWS.  THE INCIDENT SITE WAS A LOT CONTAINING TWO STRUCTURES, THE HOUSE IDENTIFIED ABOVE AND A TWO-UNIT APARTMENT COMPLEX AT 110 1/2 WEST SEVIER AVENUE.  THE LATTER LOCATION HAD BEEN DEMOLISHED THAT DAY BY A CONTRACTOR EMPLOYED BY THE HOLSTON VALLEY HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL CENTER.  INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT HAS REVEALED THAT A REPRESENTATIVE FROM HOLSTON VALLEY REQUESTED THE GAS SERVICE TO110 1/2 WEST SEVIER AVENUE BE TERMINATED AND THAT WE FIELD LOCATE THE GAS SERVICE LINE TO 110 WEST SEVIER AVENUE, WHICH BORDERED THE APARTMENT HOUSE.  THE REQUEST WAS COMPLETED ON FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 1990.  THE HOLSTON VALLEY REPRESENTATIVE REVIEWED THE SITE AND BEING SATISFIED THAT THE LINE WAS PHYSICALLY IDENTIFIED, PROCEEDED WITH THE DEMOLITION OF THE APARTMENT HOUSE.  THE CONTRACTOR, WHO LATER STATED HE WAS NOT INFORMED OF THE PRESENCE OF AN UNDERGROUND GAS LINE, DEMOLISHED AND REMOVED THE STRUCTURE AND IN THE PROCESS HE HOOKED THE GAS SERVICE LINE (3/4"" STEEL) WITH HIS EQUIPMENT.  THE LINE DID NOT BREAK AT THIS LOCATION, HOWEVER, THE STRESS RESULTED IN A BREAK NEAR A THREADED ELBOW SOME 38' 10"" AWAY.  A PORCH WHICH WAS LATER ENCLOSED HAD BEEN BUILT OVER THIS POINT CAUSING THE ENTRAPMENT OF THE ESCAPING GAS.  THIS OCCURRED SOME TIMEPRIOR TO 4:00 PM. ON MARCH 26, APPROXIMATELY FIVE HOURS PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION.  I HAVE ATTACHED A DRAWING OF THE SITE FOR BETTER REPRESENTATION.  IN CONSLUSION, IT APPEARS THE EXCAPING GAS FROM THE DAMAGED SERVICE VENTED UNDER AND INTO THE STRUCTURE FOR A MINIMUM OF FIVE HOURS.  AT APPROXIMATELY 9:00 PM. AN ELECTRICAL CONTACT FROM EITHER THE PHONE, OR THE THERMOSTAT TO THE FLOOR FURNACE MAY HAVE BEEN THE IGNITION SOURCE CAUSING THE EXPLOSION.  OUR FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION, WHICH WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE KINGSPORT FIRE DEPARTMENT, INCLUDED A PRESSURE TEST OF THE GAS FUEL LINE WHICH REMAINED INTACT AND THE GAS SERVICE LINE.  THESE TESTS CONFIRMED THE ONLY FAILURE TO EITHER OF THE SYSTEMS WAS DUE TO THE THIRD-PARTY DAMAGE."

I ARRIVED AT THE LOCATION APPROXIMATELY 2:15P.M. AND FOUNS THAT THE 2"" P.V.C. GAS MAIN HAD BEEN HIT BY A BACK HOE. LINE WAS CUT IN TWO. INSEATED PLUG (2"") AND STOPPED FLOW OF GAS.  I ADVISED,R. EMILIO MARTINEZ, OWNER, THAT HE SHOULD HAVE CALLED US TO LOCATE LINE BEFORE HE STARTED DIGGING.  HE SAID HE DIDN'T REMEMBER THAT A GAS LINE WAS THERE, SO CLOSE TO HIS SEWER LINE.  I CALLED CREW FOREMAN, LARRY MARTINEZ, AND ADVISED AS TO WHAT HAD HAPPEDNED AND HE AND HIS CREW SECURED WHERE THEY WERE WORKING AND WENT TO 925 OAK TO REPAIR DAMAGED GAS LINE.  I WAS TOLD LATER THAT LINE HAD BEEN REPAIRED AND THAT ALL UNITS HAD BEEN RELIT (7 TO 8 TRAILERS), ATABOUT 4:45 P.M.  AT ABOUT 9:50 P.M. I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE CITY P.D. THAT AN EXPLOSION HAD OCCURRED AND THAT A FIRE WAS IN PROCESS AT A LOCATION ON OAK STREET.  I THOUGHT THEN, THAT THIS MIGHT BE RELATED TO WHAT HAD HAPPENED EALIER.  I CALLED LARRY MARTINEZ AND TOLD HIM WHAT I HAD BEEN TOLD BY THE P.D.DISPATCHER AND TOLD HIM TO MEET ME AT THE LOCATION A.S.A.P.  WHEN I ARRIVED,APPROXIMATELU TEN (10) MINUTES AFTER HAVING RECEIVED THE CALL, LARRY MET ME. HE THEN LEFT TO GET THE REST OF THE CREW SO THAT WE COULD DIG UP 2"" MAIN AND TRY TO FIND WHERE GAS LEAK MIGHT BE.  LINE WAS DUG 2' TO 3' BACK TO MAIN AND FOUND WHERE 2"" P.V.C. PIPE HAD BEEN TAPPED TO 1 1/2"" P.V.C. MAIN AND THAT ITHAD BROKEN LOOSE.  WE PLUGGED LINE AND SECURED AREA FOR THE NIGHT.  LEFT AT ABOUT 1:00AM 1:15A.M., FEBRUARY 12, 1992, I CALLED ALBINO ZUNIGA WITH THE STATE CORPORATION COMMISSION AND ADVISED OF THE INCIDENT.  I TOLD HIM, AT THE TIME, I FELT THE HOUSE IN QUESTION WAS VALUED AT LESS THAN &50,000 AND THERE WERE NOT ANY INJURIES. HE ADVISED ME HE WOULD COME TO RATON AND WOULD BE OKAY IF WE COULD START REPAIR OF LINE AND RESTORE SERVICE TO THE AREA.  HE AGREED THAT WE SHOULD; BUT, TO KEEP AS MUCH OF THE DAMAGED PIPE AS POSSIBLE FOR CAUSEOF PROBLEM.  FEBRUARY 12, IN THE A.M. LARRY MARTINEZ AND CREW STARTED REPAIRIING LINE.  NEW CONNECTIONS WERE MADE TO 1 1/2"" LINE AND REATTACHED 2"" AND VALVE TO MAIN ON OAK STREET.  A PRESSURE TEST WAS APPLIED WITH AN AIR COMPRESSOR.  LINE WOULD NOT HOLD PRESSURE. UPON FURTHER CHECKING OF LINE, THEY FOUND THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER BREAK ON 2"" LINE ABOUT 30' FROM 1 1/2"" MIAN.  2"" LINE WAS SEPARATED AT A COUPLING WHICH HAD BROKEN IN HALF AND THERE WAS ABOUT 4 TO 6"" SEPARATON BETWEEN THE TWO BROKEN PARTS.  PE PIPE WAS INSTALLED AND A PRESSURE TEST WAS AGAIN APPLIED TO 60P.S.I., PRESSURE HELD.  UNITS (TRAILERS) WERERELIT AT ABOUT 3:00 P.M.  I FEEL SURE THAT WHAT CAUSED THE ESCAPE OF GAS LATER THAT NIGHT, WAS THAT THE LINE WAS BROKEN AGAIN.  AFTER THE OWNER FINISHED REPAIRINF SEWER LINE AND BACK-FILLED DITCH.  THIS IS WHEN 2ND AND 3RD BREAK OCCURRED."

THERE IS NO RECORD OF LEAKS IN THE AREA WHERE THE FAILURE OCCURRED.  IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE FAILURE WAS LOCATED ON THE PIPE, JUST ALONG SIDE THE SOCKET FUSION.

IT WAS ALSO NOTED THAT THE MAIN GOING INTO ONE LEG OF THE TEE, WAS AT A SLIGHT ANGLE.  THIS MAY HAVE PLACED UNNECESSARY STRESS ON THE PIPE AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE MATERIAL FAILURE.  A SECOND FACTOR THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE WAS THE FROST.  IN THE LOCATION OF THE INCIDENT, FROST USUALLY EXTENS 4-5' BELOW GRADE.  IN THIS CASE, HOWEVER, THE FROST EXTENDED TO A GREATERDEPTH BECAUSE THE TEE WAS BENEATH A PARKING LOT.  THE INSULATING BENEFIT OF THE SNOW IF REMOVED EACH TIME THE LOT IS CLEARED OF SNOW.  THE ADDITIONAL GROUND MOVEMENT CAUSED BY THE FROST/THAW CYCLE MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED ADDITIONAL STRESS TO THE PIPELINE.  FINALLY, RECENT THIRD PARTY EXCAVATION IN THE VICINITY OF THE PIPE, MAY HAVE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE MATERIAL FAILURE.  ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO APPARENT DAMAGE TO THE PIPE, A NEW SEWER LATERAL WAS INSTALLED BENEATH THE EXISTING PIPELINE, IN NOVEMBER 1992.  THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE LATERAL CANNOT BE DETERMINED BUT, IT IS IN THE VICINITY OF THE BREAK.  IMPROPER BACKFILLING PROCEDURES MAY HAVE CAUSED DELAYED SETTLING IN THE TRENCH AFTER THE WORK WAS COMPLETED, THUS CONTRIBUTING TO ADDITIONAL STRESS AND SUBSEQUENT FAILURE.

I RESPONDED TO A BUILDING FIRE, WHICH WAS REPORTED TO HAVE HAD A BURN VICTIM INVOLVED.  UPON MY ARRIVAL, FIRE FIGHTERS SHOWED ME WHERE THE FIRE APPARENTLY ORIGINATED.  THERE WAS A GAS HEATERLOCATED ABOVE THE ENTRANCE WAY OF THE NIGHTCLUB ON A LANDING.  APPARENTLY, AFIRE HAD STARTED THERE AND SPREAD DOWN THE WEST SIDE WALL BURNING SOME BLACKTYPE PAPER THAT WAS OVER THE WINDOWS.  THE VICTIM HAD BEEN BURNED IN THIS AREA AND FALLEN TO THE FLOOR.  AFTER I THEN INVESTIGATED THE AREA WHERE I BELIEVE THE FIRE TO HAVE STARTED, I SAW THAT THERE WAS SOME FLASH-LIKE CHARRING ALL AROUND WHERE THE CUTOFF VALVE WAS LOCATED.  THERE WAS SOME BURNT PAPER AND/OR RAGS IN THIS AREA.  FIRE FIGHTERS STARTED THAT THE VICTIM IN THIS FIRE WASAPPARENTLY ATTEMPTING TO TURN THE GAS OFF.  I THEN LEFT AND WENT TO LSU BURNCENTER TO TALK TO MR. ROBERT HALL, DATE OF BIRTH 9/13/52, WHO LIVES AT 2348 MARION STREET. MR. HALL STATED THAT HE WAS TRYING TO TURN THE GAS OFF, BECAUSE WHEN HE AND HIS COUSIN, ANGELA MAXIE ARRIVED AT THE CLUB, THE WHOLE BUILDING WAS FILLED WITH THE ODOR OF NATURAL GAS.  HE STATED THAT THEY OPENED THE DOORS TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE GAS ODOR.  AT THIS POINT, THEY HEARD A HISSING SSOUND COMING FROM THE AREA OF THE HEATER ABOVE THEE DOOR.  HE THEN GOT A LADDER, PUT IT UP, AND WENT UP TO INVESTIGATE.  HE SAW WHERE THE LEAK WAS COMING FROM, AND ASKED ANGELA TO THROW UP A WRENCH TO HIM.  SHE DID, AND AS HE ATTEMPTED TO TURN THE VALVE OFF, A FLASH ENSUED AND BURNED HIM ABOUT THE FACE AND HANDS.  I THEN QUESTIONED MS. ANGELA MAXIE, DATE OF BIRTH 12/28/67, WHO LIVESAT 2360 MARION STREET.  SHE STATED BASICALLY THE SAME THING.  SHE STATED THAT AS THEY WALKED INTO THE CLUB, THE STRONG ODOR OF NATURAL GAS COULD BE SMELLED.  SHE STATED SHE THREW UP A WRENCH TO MR. HALL, AND AS HE WENT TO TURN THEVALVE OFF, A BIG FLASH OF FIRE OCCURRED.  SHE STATED THAT HE FELL FROM THE LANDING, WHICH WAS APPROXIMATELY 10 TO 12 FEET HIGH FROM THE FLOOR.  SHE THEN DOUSED HIM WITH WATER AND PATTED OUT THE FIRE AND THEN CALLED 911 TO GET HELP.  THE NATURE OF THIS FIRE IS ACCIDENTAL, AND THE CAUSE IS A GAS LEAK, WHICH WAS POSSIBLY IGNITED BY THE ELECTRIC STARTED ON THE GAS POWERED HEATER IN THENIGHTCLUB.  THIS CASE IS CLOSED.  MR.  ROBERT HALL WAS TAKEN TO LSU BURN UNIT WHERE HE IS NOW SUFFERING FROM FIRST AND SECOND DEGREE BURNS TO THE FACE AND HANDS.  NONE OF THE INJURIES SEEM TO BE LIFE THREATENING AT THIS TIME."

HE SAID THAT HE EVEN WENT INTO THE STORE AND GOT SOME SOAP BUBBLES AND SOAPED THE EXPOSED LINES. HE ALSO ADDED THAT HIS SON SAW THE DIRT BLOWING. THE HE PROCEEDED TO GO BACK TO WORK, AND WHILE DRIVING A WEDGE TO SET UP THE TRAILER, HE CAUSED A SPARKS WHICH IGNITED THE GAS AND CAUSING THE FIRE. I TOLD MR. WILLIAMS THAT WE WERE CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION, THAT WE WERE GOING TO DIG UP THE LINESAND PRESSURE TEST THEM, AND THAT I WOULD LET HIM KNOW WHEN WE WERE GOINGTO DO THIS. ON SEPTEMBER 21, 1993, WITH MR. WILLIAMS AND HIS SON PRESENT, WETESTED THE LINES. MR. WILLIAMS SON SAID HE SAW DIRT BLOWING FROM UNDERNEATH THE SIDE OF THE TRAILER. WE TESTED THREE, 1/2 INCH LINES UNDER THE TRAILER'S SIDE AND FOUND NO LEAKS. ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE TRAILER, WE DUG UP THE LINESAND ONLY FOUND ONE 1/2 INCH LINE, TESTED IT, AND FOUND NO LEAK. WE ALSO FOUNDAN OLD CAP THAT MAY HAVE BEEN USED TO CAP-OFF THE OTHER LINE. WHILE DIGGING WE DID FIND VERY HARD DRY DIRT WITH AN ODOR TO IT THAD SMELLED OF GAS. THIS GENERALLY THE KIND OF CONDITIONS WE FIND AT LEAKS."

AND FOUND THAT THE UNOCCUPIED HOUSE  WAS ON FIRE. FIRE PERSONNEL WERE ON THE SCENE AND GAS HAD ALREADY BEEN TURNED OFF AT THE OUTSIDE METER SET. AT APPROXIMATELY 4:00 A.M., THE MAIN AND SERVICE WERE SURVEYED FOR LEAKS. NO INDICATION OF LEAKING NATURAL GAS WAS FOUND. THE GAS METER AND REGULATOR WERE REMOVED BY NJNG PERSONNEL AND DELIVERED TO PETER VALLAS ASSOCIATES, INC. OF 125 STAT STREET, HACKENSACK, NJ 07601 FOR TESTING. SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS HAD RESULTED IN A NUMBER OF ""NO HEAT"" COMPLAINTS IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY CAUSED BY ICE COVERING THE OUTSIDE METERS. NJNG WANTED TO ASSURE THAT THE SUSPECTED ICING CONDITION OF THIS METER DID NOT IN ANY WAY CAUSE THE INCIDENT. THE OCCUPANT OF THIS HOUSE, MR. WILLIAM HAHN, HAD CALLED IN A COMPLAINT OF ""NO GAS"" AT 6:18 P.M. THE PREVIOUS EVENING. HE REPORTED THAT HIS ELECTRICITY HAD ALSO BEEN OFF BUT WAS NOW BACK ON.THE FAMILY THEN LEFT TO SPEND THE NIGHT AT A NEARBY HOTEL. THE FOLLOWING DAY, THE SERVICE WAS EXCAVATED AT THE MAIN CONNECTION AND PRESSURE TESTED. THE SERVICE HEALD SYSTEM PRESSUE: 39.5 PSIG AND WAS THEN TESTED WITH AIR AT 100 PSIG FOR 10 MINUTES. AGAIN, THE PRESSURE HELD. THE .5"" DIAMETER X-TRUBE SERVICEWAS EXAMINED IN THE EXCAVATION AND FOUND TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION. THE MAINTENANCE ORDER IS ATTACHED. ARTHUR L. JACKSON, CHIEF INVESTIGATOR FOR PETER VALLAS ASSOCIATES, INC., HAS REPORTED VERBALLY THAT WHILE THE METER AND REGULATORWERE DAMAGED BY THE FIRE, THEY COULD FIND NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY FAILURE OF OUR FACILITIES OCCURRED WHICH COULD HAVE CAUSED THIS ACCIDENT.

ROOT CAUSE - POOR JUDGMENT WAS USED IN  PLACEMENT OF THESQUEEZE-OFF TOOL; IT WAS TOO CLOSE TO A GAS LEAK. NO PROVISIONS WERE MADE TODISSIPATE THE STATIC CHARGE. THE SAFETY ASPECTS OF WHAT COULD HAPPEND WERE NOTCONSIDERED PRIOR TO THIS OPERATION. ACTIONS TO PREVENT REOCCURENCES: ALLSQUEEZE-OFF TOOLS ARE NOW EQUIPPED AND PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO INSTALLGROUNDING KITS ON ALL SQUEEZE-OFF EQUIPMENT. PLASTIC PIPE TO BE SQUEEZED OFF,ALONG WITH TIE-IN OF PLASTIC PIPE, WILL BE SPRAYED WITH A SOAPY WATER SOLUTIONTO ASSIST IN DISSIPATING THE STATIC CHARGE ON THE PIPE. THE TIE-IN FUSE THATFAILED WAS MADE WITH THE OVERBEND METHOD; THIS METHOD WILL ONLY BE USED IFCONDITIONS ARE IDEAL. ALL 6"" FUSES MADE BY THIS METHOD IN THIS DISTRICT WILLBE EXCAVATED AND EVALUATED FOR PROPER MELT. A 6"" COUPLING WILL BE PLACED OVERTHESE FUSES TO PREVENT REOCCURENCES OF THIS TYPE OF GAS LEAK. A VIDEO ONSTATIC ELECTRICITY WILL BE SHOWN TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE CREWS PLUS SUPERVISIONTO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS SUBJECT. THE CREW CHIEF AND THE SUPERVISORON THE JOB SITE WERE REPRIMANDED FOR THE USE OF POOR JUDGMENT. THIS CREW ANDTHE SUPERVISOR ARE NOW HOLDING SAFETY MEETINGS WITH ALL GAS PERSONNEL IN THEREGION TO EXPLAIN THE INCIDENT AND HOW THEY FELT IT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED."

ON FEBRUARY 10, 1994, NEW JERSEY NATURAL GASCOMPANY (NJNG) RECEIVED A TELEPHONE REPORT OF AN EXPLOSION FROM THE SHIPBOTTOMPLOICE DEPARTMENT. AN NJNG SERVICEMAN ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT 3:30 A.M.AND FOUND THE BUILDING DESTROYED AND A SMALL, CONTROLLED FIRE BURNING IN THEKITCHEN AREA. FIRE AND POLICE PERSONNEL WERE AT THE SCENE BUT HAD NOT SHUT OFFTHE GAS. THE OUTSIDE METER SET WAS BLOCKED BY DEBRIS AND THE CURB VALVE BOXWAS COVERED BY ICE AND SNOW. ADDITIONAL NJNG PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO THESITE AND THE OTHER BUILDINGS IN THE AREA WERE CHECKED FOR THE PRESENCE OF GASWITH A COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR. ALL MAINS AND SERVICES UNIT. AT 6: A.M., ASINGLE LEAK WAS LOCATED. THIS LEAK WAS ON THE SERVICE RISER AT #2005PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE AND COULD NOT HAVE CONTRIBUTIED TO THE EXPLOSION. NO OTHERLEAKS WERE FOUND  AND NO INDICATION OF GAS WAS FOUND IN ANY NEARBY BUILDINGS.THE 3/4"" STEEL SERVICE LINE OT #2041 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE WAS RETIRED ATAPPROXIMATELY 7:20 A.M. AND PRESSURE TESTED WITH AIR AT THE CURRENT OPERATINGPRESSURE, 54 PSIG, FOR 20 MINUTES. THE LINE HELD THE PRESSURE. THIS SERVICELINE AND 2"" STEEL GAS MAIN IN PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE WERE EXAMINED AND FOUND TOBE IN GOOD CONDITION. COPIES OF THE MAINTANANCE ORDERS FOR THE PRESSURE TESTAND MAIN CONDITION REPORT ARE ATTACHED. THE METER BUILD-UP AND SERVICEREGULATOR WERE EXAMINED AND FOUND TO BE INTACT. THEY WERE REMOVED BY NJNG ANDHELD IN STORAGE PENDING RECEIPT OF THE FIRE MARSHAL'S REPORT WHICH IS ALSOATTACHED. THE FIRE MARSHAL'S REPORT CONCLUDES THAT THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED INTHE KITCHEN AREA WHERE THE STOVE AND WATER HEATER WERE LOCATED. THIS ISCONSISTENT WITH NJNJG'S CONCLUSION THAT OUR FACILITIES WERE NOT INVOLVED INTHE INCIDENT.AT APPROXIMATELY 1:45 PM ON THURSDAY, 01/13/94, A FIRE ERUPTED IN TRENCH S/CH 1 CONTINUATION OT HOUSES 19 AND 20. THE FIRE WAS QUICKLY EXTINGUISHED AND THERE WAS NO INJURY OR SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE. THE FIRE WAS CAUSED BY ONE OF THE LABORERS USING A PROPANE TORCH TO APPLY THE HEAT SHRINK TO THE SEWER TIE-IN. THIS REQUIRES SOME EXPLANATION. ALL OF THE UTILITIES IN THE 21 - UNIT HOUSING(SEWER, WATER AND GAS) RUN IN THE SAME TRENCH (SEE 12/21 HOUSING SERVICE CONNECTIONS, SHEET C6, DETAIL 7). OFTEN IN THE COURSE OF CONSTRUCTION, A GIVEN TRENCH MAY NOT BE COMPLETED IN ONE CONTINUOUS TIME SPAN. OFTEN THE UTILITIES ARE COMPLETED IN SEGMENTS. WHEN THIS OCCURS, THE UTILITIES ARE STUBBED-OUT (IE: CAPPED OFF) AND BURIED. WHEN THE REMAINING WORK IS TO BE DONE, THE STUBS ARE EXPOSED AND THE REST OF THE UTILITY LINES ARE THEN TIED INTO THE EXISTING LINES. THE WORK THAT WAS IN PROGRESS AT THE TIME OF IGNITION WAS THE PLACING OF THE HEAT SHRINK AT THE SEWERLINE TIE-IN. AS SHOWN IN THE ABOVE REFERENCED DRAWING, THE GAS LINE IS IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE OTHER LINES IN THE TRENCH. THE LABORER WHO WAS PERFORMING THE HEAT SHRINK WORK (FOREST AHKIVIANA) HAD NOT PLACED ANY HEAT SHIELDING OVER THE GAS LINE. SINCE THE GAS LINE IN THIS AREA IS MADE OF HDPE (HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE) THE FLAME FROM THE TORCH SOFTENED THE HDPE LINE. THE GAS DISTRIBUTION PRESSURE OF TWENTY POUNDS CAUSED THE SOFTENED PIPE TO RUPTURE AND THE GAS WAS THEN IGNITED BY THE TORCH. ONE OF THE WORKERS (BILLY ITTA) RAN TO A NEARBY VEHICLE (APPROXIMATELY 30 FEET AWAY) FOR A FIRE EXTINGUISHER AND QUICKLY EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE. I ESTIMATE THATTHE FIRE LASTED APPROXIMATELY 30 SECONDS. MEANWHILE, ANOTHER WORKER (MARK TYREE) HAD GOTTEN A CLAMP AND BEGUN TO SQUEEZE THE LINE CLOSED. BEFORE HE COULDACCOMPLISH THE TASK, A WORKER FROM BUECI (BARROW UTILITIES AND ELECTRIC COOPE"

UDOVIC WAS ATTEMPTING TO INSERT A 1 INCH STEEL PLUG INTO THE THREADED OPENING ON THE BOTTOM OF THIS SECTION OF PIPING WHEN A FIRE OCCURRED. HE SUSTAINED FIRST AND SECONDDEGREE BURNS TO HIS NOSE, HANDS, AND ARMS. THE SECOND CREWW MEMBER MR. WILLIAM MAUSER, EAST OHIO GAS TECHNICIAN, ASSISTED MR. UDOVIC OUT OF THE DITCH, ATTENDED IS IS BURNS, AND THEN EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE WITH A DRY CHEMICAL EXTINGUISHER. MR. MAUSER THEN PLUGGED THE OPENING, STOPPING THE FLOW OF GAS. AS A RESULT OF HIS INJURIES, MR. UDOVIC WAS ADMITTED TO EUCLID MERIDIA HOSPITAL FORADDITIONAL TREATMENT AND OBSERVATION. HE WAS RELEASED THE FOLLOWING DAY. UPON COMPLETION OF A THROUGH EXAMINATION OF THE WORK SITE AND AFTER INTERVIEWINGTHE TWO WORKERS, AN EXACT CAUSE OF THE FIRE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. BASED ON THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE, IT IS SUSPECTED THAT THE IGNITION SOURCE OF THE FIRE WAS A SPARK CAUSED BY METAL TO METAL CONTACT IN THE COURSE OF THE DRIP REPLACEMENT. THERE WERE NO RUNNING VEHICLES NEAR THE WORK SITE DURING THE TIMETHE WORK WAS BEING COMPLETED, AND THE TORCH USED TO APPLY THE SHRINK SLEEVESHAD BEEN PLACED BACK ON THE TRUCK PRIOR TO THE LUNCH BREAK. AN ANODE WAS TO BE ATTACHED TO THE PIPE AFTER THIS JOB WAS COMPLETED, BUT NONE OF THE CADWELDEQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS WERE PRESENT NEAR THE DITCH AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. NEITHER OF THE WORKERS ON THIS CREW ARE SMOKERS.  AFTER MR. UDOVIC WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL, A SECOND WORK CREW ARRIVED TO ASSIST MR. MAUSER IN COMPLETING THE JOB. DUE TO DAMAGE SUSTAINED IN THE FIRE, THE SHRINK SLEEVES WERE REPLACE, AND REPLACEMENT OF THE DRIP WAS COMPLETED WITHOUT INCIDENT. IN ORDERTO MINIMIZE THE CHANCES OF A RECURRENCE, ALL PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN THIS TYPEOF WORK WILL BE MADE AWARE OF THE DETAILS OF THIS INCIDENTS."

THE GAS AND ELECTRIC SERVICES TO THE TOWNHOUSE COMPLEX HAD BEEN INSTALLED IN A COMMON TRENCH IN EARLY 1987. OPERATING PRESSURE IN THE GAS SERVICE LINE WAS 60 PSI. AMBIENT TEMPERATURE IN AFTERNOON OF AUGUST 17 WAS APPROXIMATELY 85 DEGREE F. AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, AN RG&E EMPLOYEE WAS WORKING AT THE SITE TO REPAIR AN UNDERGROUND ELECTRIC CABLE (URD) FAULT. BOTH THE CABLE FAULT AND A BREAK IN THE GAS SERVICE TRACER WIRE HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY LOCATED DURING A STAKE-OUT AND FOUND TO BE IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF A FENCE POST. THE FENCE CONSISTED OF TWO SECTIONS (EACH APPROXIMATELY EIGHT FEET LONG) AND THREE POSTS WHICH HAD BEEN INSTALLED SOME TIME AFTER THE GAS AND ELECTRIC SERVICE WERE INSTALLED. AFTER THE FAULT WAS LOCATED, A TRENCH APPROXIMATELY 3 1/2' LONG X 1 1/2' DEEP WAS EXCAVATED ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE FENCE. THE ELECTRIC CABLES WERE FOUND BEHIND THE FENCE POST, ON THE WEST SIDE. THE FAULTED AREAS WERE CUT OUT IN PREPARTION FOR SPLICING IN NEW CABLE. DURING THE INSTALLATION OF HEAT SHRINK TUBING MATERIAL OVER THE FIRST COMPLETED CABLE SPLICE USING A PROPANE TORCH FLAME AS A SOURCE OF HEAT, THE EMPLOYEE WAS THROWN DIAGONALLY OUT OF THE TRENCH BY A SUDDEN BLAST AND LANDED ON HIS BACK. WHEN THEEMPLOYEE CLIMBED TO HIS FEET, HE NOTED THAT THE WOODEN FENCE WAS BEGINNING TO BURN AND HEARD A ""ROAR"". AFTER CALLING FOR HELP FROM HIS TRUCK, HE RETURNEDTO THE SCENE OF THE EXPLOSION, PICKED UP THE PROPANE TORCH (WHICH HE HAD CARRIED WITH HIM AS HE WAS THROWN OUT OF THE TRENCH AND WHICH,AT THIS POINT, WASBURNING) AND THREW IT AWAY FROM THE FIRE ONTO THE LAWN IN THE BACKYARD. HE RECALLED THAT THE FIRE HAD INCREASED IN INTENSITY AT THIS POINT. THE EMPLOYEE STATED REPEATEDLY DURING INTERVIEWS THAT HE NEITHER HEARD NOR SMELLED ESCAPING NATURAL GAS PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION, NOR DID HE EVER SEE THE GAS SERVICE LINE. AFTER THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED, EXTENSIVE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE TAKEN OF THE ENTIRE SCENE. PIECES OF GAS SERVICE TUBING, ELECTRIC CABLE, SOIL, REMAINS OF TWO FENCE POSTS AND ASSOCIATED CONCRETE, REMNANTS OF HEAT SHRINK TUBING AND ALUMINUM SPLICE CONNECTOR WERE COLLECTED AT THE SCENE OF THE INCIDENT AND BROUGHT TO THE METALLURGICAL LABORATORY FOR QUARANTINE AND EXAMINATION."

THE METERING STATION NEAR ELGIN IS DESIGNED TO ALLOW NATURAL GAS TO FLOW FROM THE HIGH PRESSURE 6 INCH MAIN OF CITIZENS GAS INTO THE LOW PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM OF CITIZENS GAS IN THE ELGIN/HIGHWAY 52 AREA. FOR A DIAGRAM OF THEMETERING STATION, SEE EXHIBIT ""A"" ATTACHED. THE NATURAL GAS TRAVELS FROM THE6 INCH MAIN THROUGH A 4 INCH FLANGED VALVE, WHICH IS LOCATED ON TOP OF THE GROUND. THE NATURAL GAS THEN FLOWS VERTICALLY THROUGH A STEEL TRANSITION INTO 2 INCH DIAMETER STEEL PIPE. THE NATURAL GAS THEN FLOWS THROUGH A 90 DEGREE ELBOW AND THEN TRAVELS HORIZONTALLY THROUGH A 2 INCH NIPPLE WITH A GAUGE PORT, THROUGH A PRESSURE REGULATOR, THROUGH A 2 INCH NIPPLE WITH A GAUGE PORT, THROUGH A METER STOP VALVE, AND THROUGH A DIAPHRAGM METER. THE NATURAL GAS, UPON LEAVING THE METER, THEN FLOWS THROUGH A METER STOP VALVE, A CHECK VALVE, AND SAFETY RELIEF VALVE, THEN THROUGH A 90 DEGREE ELBOW DOWN VERTICALLY INTO PIPEBURIED UNDER THE GROUND. UPON ARRIVING AT THE SCENE, DARRYL CROSS AND DENNISGOAD APPARENTLY SHUT OFF THE 4 INCH FLANGED VALVE, PREVENTING GAS FLOW INTO THE METERING STATION. THE MEN THEN REMOVED THE REGULATOR AND INSPECTED IT FORICE FORMATION AND BLOCKAGE ON THE REGULATOR OFFICE. ONE OF THE MEN PLACED THE REGULATOR INSIDE ONE OF THE TRUCKS IN ORDER TO THAW THE ICE FORMED ON THE ORIFICE. ONE OF THE MEN THEN CONNECTED 2 INCH DIAMETER PIPE MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 30 INCHES IN LENGTH ONTO THE METER RUN WHERE THE REGULATOR WAS PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED. ON THE END OF THE 2 INCH DIAMETER PIPE, A 90 DEGREE ELBOW WAS ATTACHED, AND THEN A SHORT SECTION OF PLASTIC PIPE. THIS 2 INCH PIPE ASSEMBLY WAS ATTACHED SO THAT THE ""L"" ASSEMBLY WAS PARALLEL TO THE GROUND. THE PIPE ASSEMBLY WAS ATTACHED IN ORDER TO DIVERT THE FLOW OF NATURAL GAS AWAY FROM A NEARBY HOUSE AND AWAY FROM THE OPERATOR OF THE 4 INCH FLANGED VALVE. DARRYL CROSS THEN POSITIONED HIMSELF OVER THE 4 INCH FLANGED VALVE AND PLACED A PIPE WRENCH ON THE VALVE STEM IN ORDER TO OPERATE THE VALVE. THE PROCEDURE INITIATEDBY MR. CROSS WAS USED TO ALLOW NATURAL GAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE 4 INCH FLANGED VALVE AND OUT THE 2 INCH PIPE ASSEMBLY IN ORDER TO CLEAR THAT SECTION OF PIPE OF ANY OBSTRUCTIONS SUCH AS AN ICE FORMATION IN THE PIPE. UPON SO DOING AND UNFORESEEABLE SURGE OF NATURAL GAS FLOWED THROUGH THE 4 INCH FLANGED VALVE AND OUT THE 2 INCH PIPE ASSEMBLY, CAUSING THE 2 INCH PIPE ASSEMBLY TO SPIN OUT OF CONTROL. WHEREUPON, THE 2 INCH PIPE ASSEMBLY HIT MR. CROSS IN THE HEAD, RENDERING HIM UNCONSCIOUS. THE 2 INCH PIPE ASSEMBLY THEN HIT DENNIS GOAD IN THE PELVIC AREA, KNOCKING HIM TO THE GROUND.

He advised me that the owner of the property (Mr. Green Woolum) had advised him that at approximately 6:00p.m., he had turned the gas on at the meter and lit the pilot lights on the hot water heater and the kitchen stove. The meter and the hot water heater arelocated in a utility room at the front of the house and are separated by a wall. On the piping from the meter to the hot water tank is a tee. On the outlet side of this is a 1/2"" shut-off valve and approximately five (5) feet of 3/8"" flexible piping which runs through the back wall of the utility room intoa laundry room. This 1/2"" shut off valve was in the open position when the Fire Department arrived on the scene. the 3/8"" flexible piping was not connected to any appliance and was allowing gas to escape into the house. No one wasin the residence at the time of the accident. From my investigation at the scene, this escaping gas was ignited by the pilot light on the kitchen stove which was the direct cause of the explosion. We have pressure-tested the service line and the house piping and both lines passed the pressure test. I belive the failure of the property owner to close the 1/2"" shut off valve prior toturning the gas on at the meter was the direct cause of this accident."

AT APPROX 9:23 A.M., ANNIE MYER OF MERRILL GRAVEL & CONSTRUCTION NOTIFIED WISCONSIN FUEL & LIGHT CO (WF&L) THAT A STEEL GAS SERVICE HAD BEEN HOOKED IN THE 300 BLOCK OF SEVENTH STREET, WITH GAS LEAKING. WF&L RESPONDED BY DISPATCHING A CONTRACTOR REPRESENTATIVE, AN EMERGENCY REPAIR VEHICLE AND A TWO-PERSON CONSTRUCTION/CREW. AT APPROX 9:33 A.M., A WF&L EMPLOYEE AT THE SITE REPORTED BACK TO THE COMPANY'S RADIO DISPATCHER THAT THE 1 1/4"" STEEL SERVICE TO 620 WASHINGTON STREET HAD BEEN SUCCESSFULLY SQUEEZED OFF AND THE LEAK HAD BEEN CONTROLLED. (IT IS CRITICAL TO NOTE HERE THAT ALTHOUGH THE TIME WHICH ELAPSEDBETWEEN THE NOTIFICATION OF THE DAMAGE TO WF&L AND CONTROL OF THE LEAK BY COMPANY PERSONNEL WAS ONLY 10 MINS., IT IS UNKNOWN HOW MUCH TIME PASSED BETWEENTHE POINT AT WHICH THE ACTUAL DAMAGE OCCURRED AND THE TIME AT WHICH WF&L WASNOTIFIED. SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THIS DAMAGE OCCURRENCE. FIRST OF ALL, THE 1-1/4"" STEEL SERVICE INVOLVED HAD NOT BEEN MARKED BY THE WF&L REPRESENTATIVE IN THE FIELD. IN ADDITION, THE SERVICE WAS NOT SHOWN ON THE WORKING DRAWINGS BEING USED FOR THE STREET RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT BY THE CONTRACTOR. THIS IS BECAUSE THE SERVICE HAD INADVERTENTLY BEEN OMITTED WHEN THE GAS FACILITIES WERE MARKED ON THE PLANS WHICH HAD BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE WF&L DRAFTING DEPARTMENT BY THE RECONSTRUCTION PLANS FOR THE CONTRACTOR PRIOR TO THE PROJECT.THE SERVICE LATERAL WAS SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL, SINCE IT SERVED A BUILDING ON A STREET OTHER THAN THE ONE IN WHICH THE MAIN WAS LOCATED. THE SERVICE TO 620 WASHINGTON STREET, (FIGURE 1), RAN FROM A 6"" STEEL MAIN ON SEVENTH STREET, THEN WEST THROUGH THE ALLEY BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND JEFFERSON STREETS. WHEN THIS SERVICE WAS INSTALLED IN 1963, THE EXISTING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ON WASHINGTON STREET COULD NOT PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE GAS SUPPLY FOR THE LAUNDROMAT THAT WAS LOCATED THERE. WHEN THE SERVICE LATERAL WAS HOOKED AND PULLED AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, IT SEPARATED AT A COMPRESSION FITTING LOCATED AT THE ALLEY, ABOUTFIVE FEET WEST OF THE SEVENTH STREET RIGHT-OF-WAY. AT APPROX 9:38 A.M., AFTER THE DAMAGED SERVICE HAD BEEN PINCHED CLOSED AND WF&L PERSONNEL WERE EVALUATING THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE TO GAS FACILITIES, AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED WITHIN THE VACANT SINGLE-FAMILY STRUCTURE AT 310 SEVENTH STREET. IT IS BELIEVED THATLEAKING GAS HAD MIGRATED UNDERGROUND FROM THE SEPARATED COMPRESSION FITTING AND PASSED THROUGH THE STONE AND CONCRETE BASEMENT WALL TO ENTER THE STRUCTURE. THERE WERE STANDING PILOT LIGHTS IN OPERATION FOR BOTH THE WATER HEATER AND THE FURNACE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION. IT IS ASSUMED THAT ONE OF THESE APPLIANCE PROVIDED THE IGNITION SOURCE.  THE RESULTING BLAST AND FIRE DESTROYED THE VACANT HOME AND GARAGE AT 310 SEVENTH STREET. ADJACENT STRUCTURES AT 308 SEVENTH STREET AND 629 JEFFERSON STREET SUSTAINED SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE AS WELL.

ALTHOUGH SOME MEDIA GROUPS REPORTED MUTLIPLE INJURIES REQUIRING HOSPITALIZATION, THERE IS IN FACT, ONLY ONE CONFIRMED INJURY. ONE SOUTHERN CA GAS COMP (THE GAS COMPANY) EMPLOYEE WAS SLIGHTLY INJURED WITH MINOR SCRAPES, BRUISES, A PUNCTURED EARDRUM AND A SMALL CUT AT THE TEMPLE AREA OF HIS HEAD. THE EMPLOYEE WAS TREATED AT A LOCAL MEDICAL CENTER AND RELEASED THE SAME AFTERNOON. ADDITIONALLY, FOUR INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE IN NEARBY STRUCTRES, HAVE FILED CLAIMS WITH THE GAS COMPANY REGARDING ALLEGED DIZZINESS AND/OR DUST INHALATION. NONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE HOSPITALIZED AND THE GAS COMP IS INVESTIGATING THE CLAIMS. AN INVESTIGATION, SPONSORED BY THE GAS COMP, WAS CONDUCTED BY AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT WHO SPECIALIZES IN PIPELINE FRACTURE MECHANICS (SEE ATTACHED). IT WAS FOUND THAT THE PIPELINE EXPLOSION RESULTED FROM FAILURE TO FOLLOW COMPANY PROCEDURES REGARDING THE FOLLOWING: THE COMPLETE PURGING OF ALLNATURAL GAS FROM A PIPELINE PRIOR TO FILLING IT WITH AN AIR/NITROGEN TEST MEDIUM. WELDING ON THE PIPELINE DURING THE TESTING OPERATION WITH A COMBUSTIBLEMIXTURE PRESENT, THE COMPANY CREW DID NOT FOLLOW ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES RELATIVE TO STRENGTH TESTING. I BELIEVE THAT THIS NARRATIVE, COUPLED WITH FORM RSPA F7100.1 AND THE CONSULTANT'S REPORT, PROVIDES ENOUGH DETAIL TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. HOWEVER, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL FIL BERNAL AT (213)244-3283 IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING OUR REPORT."

THE FOLLOWING DAY,WASHINGTON WATER POWER PERSONNEL IN THE PRESENCE OF THE BONNERS FERRY FIRECHIEF, INITIATED A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THISINCIDENT.

THEPIPE IS MELTED ONLY AT THIS LOCATION AND ONLY ON ONE SIDE OF THE PIPE.  THETRACER WIRE SHOWED EVIDENCE OF ELECTRICAL ARCING AT THIS LOCATION ALSO.

NATURAL GAS WAS BLOWING THROUGH THE CORE OF THE AUGER.  A SECOND AUGER WAS DRILLED CLOSE TO THE GAS MAIN 10 TO THE SOUTH AND A THIRD AUGER HOLE WAS LOCATED 2 NORTH OF THE DAMAGE.  AN ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING  FIRM TAKING SOIL SAMPLES DRILLED THE HOLES.  ENSTAR CREWS CLOSED PORTIONS OF THE INTERSECTION AND WORKED ALL NIGHT TO EXPOSE THE DAMAGED MAIN.  THE MAIN WAS 7 1/2 DEEP.  THE GROUND WAS FROZEN 8 DEEP.  AT 6:03 AM AST, THURSDAY, JANUARY 27, A STEEL REPAIR FITTING WAS BOLTED OVER THE LEAK TO STOP THE BLOWING GAST.  THE AUGER HAD DRILLED INTO THE MAIN, CAUSING HAIRLINE CRACKS TO FORM ON THE TOP OF THE MAIN.  THE SECOND AUGER WAS UNCOVERED AND FOUND TO HAVE ALSO DAMAGED THE 8"" MAIN.  IT HAD GLANCED OFF THE SIDE OF THE 8"" MAIN, SCRAPING THE SIDE OF THE PIPE, REMOVING APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE PIPE WALL THICKNESS.  THE THIRD AUGER HOLE WAS UNCOVERED AND FOUND THAT THE AUGER HAD STRUCK THE 8"" MAIN ""DEAD CENTER"" REMOVING APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE PIPE WALL THICKNESS.  THE DRILLER INDICATED HE HAD CEASED DRILLING IN THIS HOLE BECAUSE HE RAN INTO SOMETHING HARD AND WHEN HE PULLED UP HIS BIT HE HAD METAL SHAVINGS ON IT.  TO MAKE PERMANENT REPAIRS, A PRESSURE CONTOL FITTING WAS WELDED ON THE 8"" MAIN AND NEARBY VALVE WAS CLOSEDD TO ISOLATE THE DAMAGED SECTION OF MAIN.  A 12 SECTION OF PIPE CONTAINING ALL THREE DAMAGES WAS REMOVED AND A PIECE OF PRETESTED PIPE WAS WELDED IN ITS PLACE.  THE CONTRACTOR HAD REQUESTED LOCATES AND ENSTAR HAD LOCATED THE PIPE PRIOR TO DRILLING.  ENSTARS LOCATE MARKS WERE SEVERAL INCHES OUTSIDE THE 2 ACCURACY LIMITS PLACED ON IT BY LOCAL ORDIANCE.  HOWEVER, LOCAL ORDINANCE REQUIRES ALL LOCATED UTILITIES TO BE EXPOSED PRIOR TO EXCAVATING AND TO REPORT ANY DAMAGE IMMEDIATELY UPON KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH DAMAGE.  ENSTAR BELIEVES IT WAS UNREASONABLE FOR THE HOLES TO BE DRILLED WITHIN 5 OF ITS LINE WITHOUT PHYSICALLY EXPOSING THE PIPE.  ENSTAR ALSO BELIEVES IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED WHEN METAL SHAVINGS WERE FOUND ON THE DRILL BIT.  ENSTAR IS ACTIVELY PURSUING COLLECTION OF THIS CLAIM."

THIS INVESTIGATION INCLUDES TAKING BAR HOLE READINGS WITH A COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR AT THE APPROPRIATE LOCATIONS ALONG THE GAS SERVICE AND GAS MAIN LINES. ALL BAR HOLE READINGS SHOW NO GAS PRESENT IN THE GROUND. AFTER CONDUCTING THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION, THE GAS CREW EXCAVATES THE SERVICE AND PERFORMS A PRESSURE CHECK BETWEEN THE MAIN AND THE INSIDE SHUT OFF AT 90PSI FOR 15 MINUTES. THIS TEST SHOWED NO LOSS OF PRESSURE IN THE FACILITY. DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD, THE GAS DEPARTMENT CONDUCTED A MOBILE LEAK INVESTIGATION WITH A FLAME IONIZATION UNIT AND PERFORMED ODORIZATION CHECKS. THE F.I. SURVEY SHOWED NO INDICATION OF A LEAK IN THE STREET AND THE ODORZATION TESTS INDICATED THE APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF ODORANT IN THE GAS. 13:35 SERVICE DEPARTMENT SUPERVISOR PAUL HART ARRIVES AND DIRECTS SERVICE PERSONNEL IN PERFORMING WALL CHECKS AT NUMBERS 214,218,220,221,223,224,229,230 AND 231 PRIMROSE AVE. ALL  CHECKS SHOW NO GAS IN THE ATMOSPHERE IN THESE RESIDENCES. AT THE SAME TIME, SERVICE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL, WITH INVESTIGATORS FROM SYRACUSE FIRE DEPARTMENT, CONDUCTED AN INSIDE INVESTIGATION OF THE CUSTOMERS GAS LINES. THE GAS WAS TURNED ON AND A PRESSURE CHECK WAS DONE AT THE METER. A TEN-MINUTE TEST AT 8.9 IN. W.C. SHOWED NO MOVEMENT OF THE HALF FOOT DIAL ON THE METER. AN ADDITIONAL OPERATIONAL CHECK OF THE APPLIANCES WAS DONE. ALL WERE FOUND TO BE IN GOOD WORKING ORDER AND WERE VENTED PROPERLY. A 3/4 INCH LINE THAT TERMINATED WITH AN UNPLUGGED VALVE IN THE CLOSED POSITION WAS FOUND IN THE VICINITY OF THE ELECTRIC DRYER. THIS WAS ALSO THE APPARENT AREA OF ORIGIN OF THE FIRE/EXPLOSION. IT COULD BE DETERMINED IF EITHER NIMO OR FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL HAD CLOSED THIS VALVE. AFTER ALL TESTING WAS COMPLETED, THE UNDERGROUND SERVICE TO THIS ADDRESS WAS RENEWED USING 1"" PLASTIC PIPE. THE SERVICE WAS LEFT LOCKED IN THE OFF POSITION. ALL TESTING WAS CONDUCTED IN THE PRESENCE OF KEVIN SPEICHER OF THE NEW YORK STATE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION WHO DETERMINED THAT THE INCIDENT WAS NOT A RESULT OF ANY FAILURE ON THE PART OF NIAGARA MOHAWK OR OF NIAGARA MOHAWKS GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.

THERE WERE NO OCCUPANTS IN THE HOUSE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION AND NO INJURIES RESULTED. THE HOUSE AT 461 GROVE AVENUE WAS A TOTAL LOSS. DAMAGE WAS SUSTAINED TO HOUSES IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO 461 GROVE AVE. TOTAL DAMAGE WAS ESTIMATED IN THE RANGE OF $200,000 TO $300,00. NORTHERN INDIANA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANYS PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION REVEALED TWO POSSIBLE SOURCES OF NATURAL GAS ACCUMULATION IN THE HOME:1)A COMPANY MAINTENANCE CREW INADVERTENTLY DAMAGED THE UNDERGROUND SERVICE LINE WHEN THEY STOPPED THE FLOW OF NATURAL GAS TO BEGIN REPAIRS TO THE SERVICE LINE AT 461 GROVE AVENUE EARLIER THAT AFTERNOON. THE PLASTIC SERVICE LINE WAS DAMAGED WHEN THE CREW OPERATED A STEEL VALVE WHICH CONTAINED 5/8"" INSERTED PLASTIC LINE. THE CREW WAS UNAWARE OF THE DAMAGE, WHICH RESULTED IN THE MIGRATION OF NATURAL GAS THROUGH THE SOIL NEAR THE CUSTOMERS HOME. 2)LATER THAT SAME AFTERNOON, THE CUSTOMER TOOK FURTHER ACTION TO CHANGE HIS NATURAL GAS PIPE SYSTEM AT A POINT DOWNSTREAM FROM THE METER AND THROUGH THE FOUNDATION OF THE HOUSE. A PIPE UNION INVOLVED IN THE WORK PERFORMED BY THE CUSTOMER WAS FOUND TO BE APPROXIMATELY 1-1/2 TURNS LOOSE. THE EXTENT TO WHICH EITHER OF THESE TWO POTENTIAL SOURCES CONTRIBUTED TO THE ACCUMULATION OF NATURAL GAS WITHIN THE HOME HAS NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED. FURTHER, THE EXACT SOURCE OF IGNITION IS STILL UNKNOWN."

THE MAIN WAS OPERATING AT 149.25 PSIG AT THE TIME OF THE DIG-IN. WITHIN ONE MINUTE OF THE HIT LINE, THE OPERATOR OF THE 1994 KOMATSU,MODEL NUMBER PC400LC, HAD REMOVED HIMSELF FROM THE OPERATORS CAB OF THE TRAC-HOE AND BEGAN TO BLOCK TRAFFIC. A CITY OF MESA POLICE OFFICER WHO WAS DRIVING BY EXCAVATION SITE AT THE TIME OF THE DIG-IN, HAD STOPPED TO AID THE OPERATOR WHEN THE VENTING NATURAL GAS IGNITED. THE RESULTING FIRE FROM THE NATURAL GAS LINE IGNITING, CAUSED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE TRACHOE, SEVERAL OVERHEAD UTILITY LINES (ELECTRIC, CABLE TV, TELEPHONE), ONE POWER POLE, AN ADVERTISING SIGN TO A LOCAL BUSINESS OFFICE COMPLEX, AND ONE LARGE PALM TREE. THERE WERE NO INJURIES, MEDICAL EMERGENCIES, OR DEATHS AS A RESULT OF THE DIG-IN. TWO GAS VALVES WERE CLOSED AND THE DIG-IN IS ESTIMATED TO BE $13,563.08 OR 2,811 DKTH, BASED ON THE COST OF GAS AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. DAMAGE ASSESSMENTS ESTIMATED TO PROPERTY LOSSES HAVE YET TO BE DETERMINED, HOWEVER IT IS SAFE TO ASSUME THE LOSS WILL EXCEED THE REPORTING LIMITS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS. THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT POINTS TO TWO FACTORS. FIRST THE CITY OF MESAS UTILITY LOCATE OR ""BLUE STAKE MARK"" WAS FOUND TO BE FIVE (5) FEET EAST OF THE ACTUAL LOCATION OF THE FOUR (4"") HP NATURAL GAS MAIN. THE SECOND WAS THE CONTRACTOR, ARCHON,INC. FAILED TO ""POTHOLE"" AND LOCATE THE HP GAS NATURAL GAS MAIN PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF EXCAVATION ACTIVITY FOR THE INSTALLATION OF A SEWER MANHOLE. THE MAJOR SAFETY ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THIS REPORT ARE THE ADEQUACY OF THE UTILITY LOCATE MARKS BY THE CITY OF MESA AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF AN EXCAVATION ACTIVITY FOR THE INSTALLATION OF A SEWER MANHOLE. THE MAJOR SAFETY ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THIS REPORT ARE THE ADEQUACY OF THE UTILITY LOCATE MARKS BY THE CITY OF MESA AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF AN EXCAVATOR TO: ""NOTIFY EITHER THE OWNER OF AN UNDERGROUND FACILITY OR AN ORGANIZATION DESIGNATED BY THE OWNER IF THE EXCAVATOR ENCOUNTERS AN UNDERGROUD FACILITY THAT HAS NOT BEEN MARKED OR HAS BEEN MARKED IN THE WRONG LOCATION""(ARIZONA REVISED STATUE, (ARS)40-360-23). AS A RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION, SUBSEQUENT AFTER ACTION REVIEWS, AND INTERVIEWS WITH RESPONSIBLE PARTIES FOR EACH ORGANIZATION INVOLVED, CORRECTIVE ACTION FOR EACH OF THE MAJOR SAFETY ISSUES HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED AND IMPLEMENTED.

THIS EVENT WAS REPORTED AS A FIRE AND EXPLOSION WHICH RESULTED IN PROPERTY DAMAGE OF MORE THAN $50,000.00. AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT, IT WAS SUSPECTED THAT NATURAL GAS WAS INVOLVED. MORE CAREFUL INVESTIGATION DONE SINCE THE EVENT INDICATES THAT THE EVENT WAS NOT CAUSED BY A RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS. THE COMPANY HAS LEARNED THAT:(A) THE FURNACE AT THE SUBJECT ADDRESS WAS FUELED BY OIL AND NOT BY GAS; (B) THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED TO A FIRE CALL EARLIER ON NOVEMBER 3 WHILE AN OIL TECHNICIAN WAS PRESENT WORKING ON THE OIL FIRED FURNACE; (C)WITNESSES HAVE REPORTED THAT THERE WAS A ""HEAVY OIL SMELL"" IN THE BUILDING; (D) NO ONE REPORTED SMELLING GAS;AND (E) BAR HOLE TESTING SHOWED THAT NATURAL GAS WAS NOT MIGRATING TO THE BUILDING.

BASED ON BERKSHIRES ANALYSIS, THE OVERPRESSURE OF THE PITTSFIELD LOW-PRESSURE SYSTEM WAS CAUSED BY FLOODING OF THE EAST STREET REGULATOR PIT CREATED WHEN A GENERAL CONTRACTORS SITE DRAINAGE CONTROL MEASURES IN THE AREA OF THE REGULATOR PIT PREVENTED PROPER DRAINAGE AND SUBSEQUENT LOW-PRESSURE SYSTEM. THE COMPANY, IN-CONJUNCTION WITH THE STREET RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT, IS PRESENTLY INSTALLING NEW REGULATOR PITS TO REPLACE THIS PIT. THE EAST STREET LOW-PRESSURE REGULATOR STATION CONSISTS OF TWO (2) FISHER 298 TEK REGULATORS CONFIGURED IN A WORKING MONITOR CONFIGURATION. THE PIT WAS ORIGINALLY EQUIPPED WITH TWO 8"" VENT STACKS FOR VAULT VENTILATION. THREE (3) FISHER 61H PILOTS ARE USED IN THIS CONFIGURATION WITH THE OVERRIDE PILOT VENT LINE VENTED IN ONE OF THE 8"" VENT STACKS. THE VENT LINES FOR THE PILOTS WERE RUN TO THE TOP OF THE REGULATOR VAULT AND ""CANDY CANED"" OVER. THE FIRST STAGE REGULATION REDUCES PRESSURES FROM 100 PSIG TO 10 PSIG. THE SECOND STAGE REGULATION REDUCES THE 10 PSIG TO 12"" WC (WATER COLUMN). DUE TO MAJOR ROAD RECONSTRUCTION IN THE AREA OF THE REGULATOR PIT AND THE RELOCATION OF THE ROADWAY, THE REMOVAL OF THE EXISTING VENT STACK WAS NECESSARY TO ACCOMMODATE THIS CONSTRUCTION. BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE OF WATER/DRAINAGE CONDITIONS IN THE AREA, THE COMPANY RE-VENTED THE EXISTING OVERRIDE PILOT INSIDE OF THE REGULATOR PIT BASED ON PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE THAT THE PIT HAS NOT HAD WATER PROBLEMS AND THAT THIS VENTING MODIFICATION WAS ONLY A TEMPORARY CONDITION UNTIL THE NEW PIT WAS ACTIVATED. ON SUNDAY JUNE 3, THE PITTSFIELD AREA EXPERIENCED A RAINFALL EVENT IN WHICH RAINFALL IN THE AREA OF THE REGULATOR PIT WAS NOT ABLE TO DRAIN PROPERLY INTO THE CATCH BASINS DUE TO THE RESTRICTION CAUSED BY HAY BAILS SURROUNDING THE CATCH BASIN.THIS SITUATION CAUSED FLOODING IN THE AREA OF THIS REGULATOR PIT. THE FLOODING WAS SUCH THAT WATER ENTERED THE REGULATOR PIT AND ENTERED THE RELOCATED OVERRIDE PILOT VENT LINES AND CAUSED THE REGULATORS TO FAIL. THE ROAD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR COINCIDENTALLY WAS ON-SITE TO RECTIFY THE DRAINAGE PROBLEM AND HAD BEEN CONTACTED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES BECAUSE OF THE FLOODING THEY WERE CAUSING. THE CONTRACTOR REMOVED THE HAY BAILS AND THE DRAINAGE SYSTEM IMMEDIATELY REMOVED THE FLOODING CONDITION, WHICH ALLOWED BERKSHIRE GAS OPERATIONS STAFF TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE REGULATOR PIT AND REMOVE WATER IN THE PIT. WHEN THE WATER ENTERED THE VAULT. THE WATER PRESSURE FILLED THE PILOT VENT PIPING, AND CHANGED THE SETTINGS OF THE PILOT DUE TO THE WATER PRESSURE. WHEN THE VAULT WAS PUMPED THE SPRING PRESSURE OF THE PILOT PUSHED THE WATER OUT OF THE VENT LINES AND THE PIT RETURNED TO NORMAL OPERATION. AT NO TIME DID ANY WATER ACTUALLY GET INTO THE PILOTS OR REGULATORS. THE REGULATOR PIT WAS THEN RETURNED TO SERVICE AND IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT SYSTEM PRESSURES BACK TO NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURES. BASED ON THE TIMING OF EVENTS IT BELIEVED THE OVERPRESSURIZATION OCCURRED FOR APPROXIMATELY 1.5 HOURS. UPON IDENTIFICATION OF THE INCIDENT, THROUGH THE INITIATION OF SYSTEM ALARMS BEGINNING AT 10:50AM AND ASSESSMENT OF CONDITIONS, BERKSHIRE IMPLEMENTED ITS EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES WHICH INCLUDED THE INVESTIGATION OF NUMEROUS LOCATIONS TO IDENTIFY WHETHER THE SITUATION HAD IMPACTS TO BERKSHIRE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM OR CUSTOMER SERVICES. BASED ON THE EFFORTS CONDUCTED BY BERKSHIRE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT (WHICH INVOLVED INSPECTING OVER 2000 SERVICE LOCATIONS OVER APPROXIMATELY A 28 HOUR PERIOD) IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE OVER-PRESSURIZATION EVENT DID NOT IMPACT THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INTERGRITY OR CUSTOMER SERVICES. AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT THE COMPANY ISOLATED THIS REGULATOR PIT FROM THE SYSTEM THE FOLLOWING DAY SO AS TO PREVENT ITS REOCCURRENCE. WHEN THE NEW REGULATOR PIT IS ACT"

AN ENSTAR SERVICE TECHNICIAN WAS DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE. THE ANCHORAGE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ALSO NOTIFIED. THE ON-CALL SUPERVISOR AND DISTRIBUTION PERSONNEL WERE CALLED IN TO RESPOND. UPON ARRIVAL AT THE LOCATION OF THE GAS LEAK, THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN REPORTED FINDING A 6"" STEEL MAIN PULLED OUT OF A DRESSER COUPLING AND GAS BLOWING AT 60 PSIG FROM BOTH ENDS OF THE MAINS. ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEES WERE CALLED IN INCLUDING THE VP OF OPERATIONS VP OF ENGINEERING AND THE DISTRIBUTION SUPERVISOR ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICE EMPLOYEES. AT APPROXIMATELY 9:30 PM ENSTARS VP OF OPERATIONS ARRIVED AT THE LOCATION OF THE LEAK AND SET UP A COMMAND SITE WITH ENSTARS ON-CALL SUPERVISOR AND THE ANCHORAGE FIRE DEPARTMENT (AFD). AFD WAS IN THE PROCESS OF EVACUATING HOMES WITHIN A ONE-BLOCK RADIUS OF THE BLOWING GAS. TWO VALVES ON THE 6"" MAIN NEEDED TO BE CLOSED AND A 4"" HDPE MAIN NEEDED TO BE SQUEEZED OFF TO ISOLATE THE BLOWING GAS. AT 9:45 PM, AN ENSTAR CREW CLOSED ONE 6"" VALVE TO ISOLATE THE BLOWING GAS FROM THE WEST SIDE OF THE BREAK. THE CREW THEN WENT TO THE 6"" VALVE SEVERAL BLOCKS TO THE EAST. THEY OBTAINED UTILITY LOCATES ON THE BURIED VALVE. THE VALVE WAS EXCAVATED AND SHUT DOWN AT 11:08 PM. SIMULTANEOUSLY A SECOND CREW WORKED ON GETTING UTILITY LOCATES AND EXPOSING THE 4"" HDPE MAIN. THE 4"" MAIN WAS PINCHED OFF AT 11:26 PM TO STOP ALL BLOWING GAS. APPROXIMATELY 175 CUSTOMERS WERE LEFT WITHOUT NATURAL GAS SERVICE UNTIL REPAIRS WERE MADE. CREWS WORKED THROUGH THE NIGHT TO REPAIR THE 6"" MAIN. THE MAIN WAS PUT BACK IN SERVICE AT APPROXIMATELY 7:00 AM, TUESDAY, AUGUST 21, 2001. GAS SERVICE TO THE AFFECTED CUSTOMERS WAS TURNED ON THROUGHOUT THAT DAY. UPON INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT A CONTRACTOR, WHILE INSTALLING A CONCRETE ELECTRICAL DUCT BANK SYSTEM, HAD PARTIALLY AND/OR ENTIRELY EXPOSED ENSTARS 6"" STEEL MAIN FOR APPROXIMATELY 150. THE 6"" GAS MAIN WAS LEFT EXPOSED AND UNSUPPORTED IN THE SIDE BANK OF THE OPEN DITCH EXCAVATION. ENSTAR SUSPECTS VIBRATIONS FROM CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT AND COMPACTION EQUIPMENT CAUSED THE SIDES OF THE OPEN EXCAVATION TO SLOUGH AND MOVE THE GAS MAIN, CAUSING THE 6"" GAS MAIN TO PULL OUT OF A 6"" DRESSER COMPRESSION COUPLING LOCATED AT A 90 DEGREE ELL. ENSTAR HAD RECEIVED NO PRIOR NOTIFICATION FROM THE CONTRACTOR THAT THE MAIN WOULD BE EXPOSED OR A REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE IN SUPPORTING THE 6"" MAIN. THE CONTRACTOR DID NOT SUPPORT OR RESTRAIN THE 6"" GAS MAIN. ENSTAR IS AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE CONTRACTOR FOR ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REPAIRS."

AT 3:32 PM THE DOMINION EAST OHIO SUPERVISOR ON SITE CALLED GAS CONTROL TO INFORM THEM THAT THE GAS HAD CAUGHT FIRE AND PROPERTY AND AUTOMOBILES WERE BEING DAMAGED BUT NO INJURIES TO ANY HUMANS HAD OCCURRED. LOCAL FIRE, RESCUE AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS HAD ALL ARRIVED AT THE SITE AND WERE WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH ALL INVOLVED TO HELP PUT OUT THE FIRE AND PROTECT THE PEOPLE IN THE AREA. THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED AROUND 3:50 PM WITH SIGNIFICANT FIRE DAMAGED TO LOCAL ESTABLISHMENTS, INFRASTRUCTURE AND AUTOMOBILES IN THE VICINTY. THE DAMAGED PORTION OF THE 20"" PIPELINE WAS REPLACED WITH NEW 20"" PIPE WHICH WAS JOINED BY WELDED JOINTS AND RECONNECTED AT THE ENDS BY DRESSER COUPLINGS AND REINFORCED WITH LUGS TO ADD EXTRA SUPPORT TO THE PIPELINE. TO MINIMIZE THE POSSIBILITY OF A RECURRENCE OF THIS SITUATION DOMINION EAST OHIO WILL WORK WITH THE CONTRACTOR PERFORMING THE SEWER PROJECT TO LUG ANY EXPOSED DRESSER COUPLED PIPE IT EXPOSES IN THE FUTURE OF THIS PROJECT IN MAPLE HEIGHTS. THE CONTRACTOR WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO CONTINUE TO USE AND SUPPORT THE OHIO UTILITIES PROTECTION SYSTEM. ADDITIONALLY, EACH DOMINION EAST OHIO DIVISION MANAGER WILL BE INFORMED OF THE DETAILS OF THIS INCIDENT SO THAT IT CAN BE REVIEWED WITH THE APPROPRIATE PERSONNEL IN THEIR DIVISION."

THE LEAK WAS INTENTIONALLY IGNITED TO ELIMINATE NATURAL GAS ACCUMULATION IN THE BELLHOLE. THE CREW THEN PROCEEDED TO WELD ON A STOPPLE FITTING TO ISOLATE THE LEAKING TEE. AS THIS WAS A SINGLE FEED LINE WITH ONLY 3 CUSTOMERS PAST THE LEAK SITE, A DECISION WAS MADE TO USE A SINGLE STOPPLE FITTING AND RELIGHT THE CUSTOMERS. AFTER THE FITTING WAS WELDED, IT WAS TESTED AND TAPPED. PRIOR TO TAPPING IT WAS NOTICED THAT A BY-PASS, OR BLEEDER VALVE, WAS NOT IN PLACE ON THE TAPPING MACHINE. A VALVE WAS REMOVED FROM A SWEEP MACHINE AND PLACED ON THE TAPPING MACHINE. THE TAP WAS MADE, THE TAPPING MACHINE REMOVED, AND THE SWEEP MACHINE WAS INSTALLED TO REMOVE ANY STEEL SHAVINGS PRIOR TO INSTALLING THE STOPPER. AT THIS POINT, THE CREW FAILED TO REPLACE THE BLEEDER VALVE THAT HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE SWEEP MACHINE. AS AN AVISTA EMPLOYEE OPENED THE SANDWICH VALVE TO INSERT THE SWEEP TOOL, A RELEASE OF GAS AT APPROXIMATELY 55 PSIG OCCURRED THROUGH A 1/4"" HOLE WHERE THE BLEEDER VALVE SHOULD HAVE BEEN. THE GAS WAS IGNITED FROM THE STANDING FLAME ON THE LEAKING SERVICE TEE AND ROLLED THROUGH THE DITCH. THE AVISTA EMPLOYEE WAS ABLE TO REACT AND TURN AWAY FROM THE FLAME, BUT HIS ARM WAS BURNED FROM ABOVE HIS GLOVE AT THE RIGHT WRIST TO ABOVE HIS RIGHT ELBOW. THE EMPLOYEE WAS PULLED FROM THE DITCH, THE FIRE EXTINGUISHED AND THE SANDWICH VALVE WAS CLOSED TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER RELEASE OF GAS. THE EMPLOYEE WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR 3 DAYS AT THE EMANUEL BURN CENTER IN PORTLAND, OREGON. HE IS EXPECTED TO MAKE A FULL RECOVERY AND DID RETURN TO WORK A COUPLE OF WEEKS FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT. MEETINGS WERE HELD WITH FIELD PERSONNEL AND OTHER APPROPRIATE STAFF AFTER THIS INCIDENT TO DISCUSS AND REVIEW THE EVENT.

UPON EXCAVATION ON THE RISER, DRIED SOILS, WERE LOCATED AROUND THE AREA OF THE MOISTURE SEAL OF THE PRE-MANUFACTURED ""PERFECTION"" RISER. THE SOIL CONDITIONS ENCOUNTERED IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA SURROUNDING THE MOISTURE SEAL PRESENTED THOSE TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A LEAK. PICTURES WERE TAKEN TO DOCUMENT ENCOUNTERED CONDITIONS. THE SERVICE LINE WAS RE-PRESSURE TESTED TO IDENTIFY IF THE RISER WAS THE LEAKAGE SOURCE. THE PRESSURE TEST DID INDICATE THAT LEAKAGE ON THE BOTTOM PORTION OF THE MOISTURE SEAL WAS PRESENT BASED ON VISUAL OBSERVATION AND EMPLOYEES FEELING LEAKAGE ALONG THIS AREA. IT WAS THEN DECIDED TO REMOVE THE SERVICE RISER AND PRESSURE TEST THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE SERVICE LINE TO CHECK ITS INTEGRITY. THE SERVICE RISER WAS REMOVED (CUT) FROM THE SERVICE LINE AT A POINT APPROXIMATELY EIGHT INCHES UPSTREAM OF THE FIELD/MANUFACTURED JOINT. A DEAD END CAP WAS FUSED ONTO THE SERVICE LINE. A PRESSURE TEST WAS THEN CONDUCTED TO TEST THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE SERVICE LINE. THE TEST WAS CONDUCTED AND THE SERVICE LINE MAINTAINED A PRESSURE OF 100 PSIG FOR A 30 MINUTE PERIOD. A PRESSURE RECORDING CHART WAS UTILIZED TO DOCUMENT TEST RESULTS. BASED ON THE FIELD RESULTS, IT IS FELT THE PRE-MANUFACTURED ""PERFECTION"" SERVICE RISER MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT. THE SERVICE RISER WAS TAKEN FROM THE SITE BY BERKSHIRE GAS AND TRANSFERRED OVER TO THE MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND ENERGY (MADTE) -PIPELINE ENGINEERING AND SAFETY DIVISION WHERE IT CURRENTLY RESIDES.
