FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1987, CHEVRON PIPE LINE COMPANY SHUT DOWN THE SECTION OF ITS PIPELINE THAT DELIVERS MOTOR GASOLINE TO EASTLAND, LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 100 MILES WEST OF FORT WORTH. THE COMPANY'S METERING SYSTEM HAD SHOWN A SHORTAGE OF PRODUCT DELIVERY INDICATING A PROBLEM, WHICH LATER WAS DISCOVERED TO BE A LEAK. INSPECTION OF THE PIPELINE BEGAN IMMEDIATELY, BUT WAS HINDERED BY HEAVY RAIN AND RESULTING HIGH WATER. RESPONSE CREWS WERE ALERTED. SPILLCONTAINMENT EQUIPMENT WAS DEPLOYED, AND APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES NOTIFIED. AT DAYLIGHT SATURDAY MORNING, CREWS CONTINUED INSPECTING THE PIPELINE BY WALKING THE RIGHT-OF-WAY AND BY AERIAL SURVEILLANCE. AT 10 A.M. SATURDAY, FEBRUARY28, 1987, THE LEAK WAS CONFIRMED AND LOCATED SOME 20 MILES SOUTHWEST OF MINERALWELLS, TEXAS, 35 MILES WEST OF FORT WORTH. THE LEAK WAS STOPPED AND VISIBLE SURFACE GASOLINE WAS CONTAINED AND RECOVERED USING VACUUM TRUCKS, IT IS ESTIMATED AT LEAST 400 BARRELS OF LEADED GASOLINE WAS SPILLED. THE PIPELINE LEAK OCCURRED IN A FLOODED CREEK THAT FLOWED INTO OTHER TRIBUTARIES. CLEAN UP EFFORTS WERE INITIATED USING THE SPILL CONTAINMENT EQUIPMENT AND VACUUM TRUCKS. AS LATE AS 9 P.M.SATURDAY, INSPECTIONS BY CHEVRON WITH THE EPA AND CITY WATER DEPARTMENT SHOWED NO GASOLINE BEYOND THE SPILL LOCATION. AT 6 A.M. SUNDAY, MARCH 1, 1987, THE WATERTREATMENT PLANT OF THE CITY OF MINERAL WELLS DETECTED THE ODOR OF GASOLINE. AROUND 10 A.M., THREE INDIVIDUALS IN ONE OF THE OUTLYING COMMUNITIES REPORTED A GASOLINE ODOR IN THEIR WATER. AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE, LOCAL CITIZENS WERE ADVISED TO NOT DRINK THE WATER. THIS INFORMATION WAS COMMUNICATED BY LOCAL TELEVISIONAND RADIO STATIONS. CHEVRON ARRANGED THE DELIVERY OF BOTTLED WATER TO MINERAL WEELLS AND ASSISTED THE CITY IN DISPENSING IT TO AREA CITIZENS. SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE FOR DELIVERIES TO NURSING HOMES AND TO PEOPLE CONFINED TO THEIR HOMES. WATER WAS ALSO SET ASIDE FOR THE DELIVERY TO LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. CHEVRON WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE BOTTLED WATER UNTIL CHEVRON AND THE CITY OF MINERAL WELLS WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ARE ASSURED THE WATER SUPPLY IS SAFE TODRINK. CHEVRON SENT WATER SAMPLES COLLECTED SUNDAY TO A FORT WORTH LABORATORY FOR CHROMATOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS. THE RESULTS OF THESE ANALYSES SHOWED LESS THAN 1 PPM GASOLINE. ADDITIONAL TESTING WILL BE CONDUCTED TO CONFIRM THESE RESULTS. CHEVRON CONTINUES AROUND-THE-CLOCK MONITORING FOR THE PRESENCE OF GASOLINE AT THE CITY'S WATER TREATMENT PLANT AND THE LEAK SITE. CHEVRON IS ALSO PROVIDING PERSONNELWITH RADIO-EQUIPPED TRUCKS TO ASSIST THE MINERAL WELLS WATER DEPARTMENT. CHEVRON IS ALSO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE CITY IN A COOPERATIVE EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. THE CITY OF MINERAL WELLS LAST  NIGHT, MARCH 2, 1987, STARTED AN EXTENSIVE TREATMENT PROCESS ON ADVICE OF THEIR NEWLY HIRED CONSULTANT, AID CONSULTING ENGINEERS, INC. OF DALLAS, TEXAS. THE PROCESS WILL ESTABLISH A BASE LINE EVALUATION OF THE TOTAL WATER SYSTEM BY COMPREHENSIVE SAMPLING. ACTIVATED CARBON(CHARCOAL) WAS ADDED AT THE WET WELL WHICH TAKES SUCTION FROM PALO PINTO CREEK, THE MAJOR SOURCE OF THE CITY'S WATER SUPPLY. CHARCOAL WAS ALSO ADDED AT THE WEIRS IN THE MAIN WATER TREATMENT PLANT. THE CHARCOAL REMOVES IMPURITIES FROM THE WATER, AROMATICS IN PARTICULAR. THE CONSULTANT ALSO ADVISED THAT THE WATER SYSTEM BE FLUSHED, AFTER THE CHARCOAL IS IN PLACE, BY OPENING FIRE HYDRANDS AT THE MOST DISTANT POINTS FROM THE MAIN TREATMENT PLANT. PROGRESS WILL BE MEASURED BY ADDITIONAL SAMPLING. AT MIDNIGHT SUNDAY, MARCH 2, 1987, THE CITY PUT INTO OPERATION ITS AUXILIARY WATER TREATMENT FACILITY WHICH UTILIZES WATER FROM MINERAL WELLS LAKE NEARBY. THIS SYSTEM, HOWEVER, IS ONLY CAPABLE OF SUPPLYING ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF THETOTAL CITY WATER USAGE. TOLERANCE LIMITS OBTAINED BY THE CITY FROM THE TEXAS DEP"

THE LINE WAS SHUTDOWN.INITIAL EXCAVATION OF A BELL HOLE WAS STARTED TO ASSESS WHETHER A TEMPORARY REPAIR COULD BE MADE OR PERMAENT REPAIRS WOULD BE REQUIRED.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A TEMPORARY REPAIR COULD NOT BE MADE.  THE PLAN WASTO PURGE THE PIPELINE WITH NITROGEN INJECTED BEHIND A 4 CUP SWAB AT MP 193.634 AND DISPLACE TO THE BLOCK VALVE AT MP 182.570 ( APPROXIMATELY A 10-MILE SECTION).  THE PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED,NITROGEN ORDERED AND PREPARATIONS OF THE LINE WERE STARTED FOR THE DISPLACEMENT.  THE BACKHOE OPERTOR WAS TO EXCAVATE AND EXPOSE THE LINE EASTERLY AND WESTERLY TO A POINT WHERE THE NEW PIPE COULD BE WELDED INTO THE EXISTING PIPELINE.  THE BACKHOE OPERATOR STARTED, APPROXIMATELY 26 FEET EASTOF THE LEAK, DOUBLE DITCHING ALONG THE LINE EXPOSING 55 FEET OF PIPE. THE OPERATOR THEN MOVED THE BACKHOE TO A POINT APPROXIMATELY 33 FEET WEST OF THE LEAK TO DUPLICATE THE PIPELINE EXPOSURE AND STRIPPING. SHORTLY AFTER COMMENCING WORK (2 TO 3 BUCKETS FULL) THE OPERATORLIFTED THE BUCKET AND OUTRIGGER PADS SUFFICIENTLYENOUGH TO MOVE AND PROCEEDED TO A POINT APPROXIMATELY 132 FEET WEST OF THE LEAK.IT WAS AT THIS TIM, APPROX. 15:55, A WITNESS REPORTED TO HEAR THE ENGINE OF THEBACKHOE BEGIN TO ""REV"", WHICH THE WITNESS BELIEVED TO BE THE SOUND OF NORMAL ACCELERATION AND NOT OF T\AN ENGINE BEGINNING TO RUN AWAY. WITNESSES THEN REPORTEDTHAT THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION AND FIRE. THE OPERATOR, BACKHOEAND THE AREAS SURROUNDING THE LEAK WERE ENGULFED IN FLAMES. SHORTLY AFTER IGNITION, THE FIRE WAS LIMITED TO THE LEAK AREA APPROX. 30 FEET IN DIAMETER. THE FIRE WAS MONITORED AND ALLOWED TO BURN AND WHEN THE SWAB AND NITROGEN WHICH HAD BEEN INJECTED PASED THE LEAK SITE, THE FIRE IMMEDIATELY SUBSIDED. THE LPG SATURATED SOIL WAS ALLOWED TO BURN SEVERAL HOURS TO ENSURE ELIMINATION OF ALL LPG VAPORS IN THE AREA AND THE POTENTIAL OF A FLASHBACK. WATER FURNISHED BY VACUUM TRUCKS AND WITH THE ASSISTANCEOF THE LOCAL VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPT. THE REMAINING GROUND FIRES WERE EXTINGUISHED AAND THE ENTIRE AREA SATURATED WITH WATER. THE OPERATOR PASSED AWAY AT 22:10, 10/12/88, FROM COMPLICATIONS RESULTING FROM BURNS RECEIVED."

AT THAT TIME, EXXON BEGAN SHUTTING IN PRODUCTION PLATFORMS AND CHECKING SYSTEMS IN THE AREA OF THE SIGHTING TO DETERMINE IF AN EXXON FACILITY WAS THE SOURCE OF THE SPILL.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT TEXACO MAY HAVE ALSO REPORTED A SIGHTING.  TEXACO AND EXXON COORDINATED INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE SPILL SOURCE AND MOBILIZATION OF SPILL CLEANUP EQUIPMENT.  AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING, THE SEAS WERE 3-5 FEET, WITH THE WINDS FROM THE  NORTH AT 10-15 MPH AND A SOUTHERLY CURRENT.  THE RAINBOW SHEEN COVERED AN AREA OF APPROXIMATELY 2 MILES BY 5 MILES AND WAS MOVING TO THE SOUTH.  ON THE AFTERNOON OF MAY 9, 1990, TEXACOINFORMED EXXON THAT A DAMAGED SUBSEA ONE-INCH VALVE ON AN OUT-OF-SERVICE EXXON PIPELINE WAS BELIEVED TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE SPILL.  EXXON CONTACTED THE MMS AND USCG AND ADVIXED THEM OF THIS INFORMATION ON THE SAME DAY.  THIS PIPELINE (MMS PIPELINE SEGMENT NO. 4030) ORGINATES AT EXXON'S EUGENE ISLAND BLOCK314 ""B"" PLATFORM AND TERMINATES AT A SUBSEA TIE-IN TO A EUGENE ISLAND PIPELINE SYSTEM.  THE ONE-INCH VALVE WAS LOCATED AT THE SUBSEA TIE-IN AND WAS TO BEUSED DURING THE INSTALLATION OF SEGMENT 4030 TO PRESSURE TEST THE SUBSEA COMPONENTS AND DURING ABANDONMENT FOR RELIEVING PRESSURE BETWEEN THE BLOCK VALVEAND CHECK VALVE.  EXXON HAS NOT PRODUCED OIL THROUGH THIS PIPELINE SINCE OCTOBER, 1988, AT WHICH TIME THE PIPELINE WAS FLUSHED WITH INHIBITED SEAWATER AND AN EIGHT-INCH SUBSEA BLOCK VALVE WAS CLOSED ON EXXON'S LINE NEAR THE TIE-IN.  FOLLOWING THE DAMAGE TO THIS ONE-INCH VALVE, CRUDE OIL APPARENTLY FLOWED THROUGH AN OPEN VALVE OWNED BY AND LOCATED ON THE EUGENE ISLAND PIPELINE SYSTEMINTO THE TIE-IN SPOOL AND OUT OF THE HOLE CAUSED BY THE BREAKING OFF OF THEONE-INCH VALVE.  DIVERS RECOVERED THE DAMAGED ONE-INCH VALVE.  THE SOURCE OFDAMAGED TO THE VALVE REMAINS UNKNOWN, ALTHOUGH APPARENTLY SUBSTANTIAL EXTERNAL FORCE WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO BREAK OF THE VALVE FROM THE PIPELINE.  PIPELINE 4030 HAS BEEN SINCE DISCONNECTED FROM THE SUBSEA TIE-IN &  BLIND FLANGES ARE BEING INSTALLED.  ON MAY 14, 1990, EXXON  CONTACTED THE NRC FOR THE PURPOSE OF UPDATING REPORT NO. 20677.

HERE IS A SUMMARY OF EVENTS:  CONSISTENT WITH APL'S ON-GOING EFFORT TO ELIMINATE POSSIBLE PROBLEMS FROM IDLE LINES, APL DECIDED TO PURGE ITS #2 CRUDE SYSTEM BETWEEN LAPLATA AND FREEMAN, MISSOURI, WITH NITROGEN AND DECOMMISSION IT.  APL CONTRACTED WITH UCISCO, A NITROGEN SERVICE COMPANY, TO SUPPLY NITROGEN FOR THE CRUDE OIL OUT OF THE LINE INTO A TANK AT FREEMAN.  UCISCO'S TWO NITROGEN TRUCKS WERE CONNECTED TO THE PIPELINE, AND THE PUMPING OF NITROGEN INTO THE PIPELINE COMMENCED ON MONDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1990, ATABOUT 13:20 AND CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON.  LATE IN THE AFTERNOON, ONE OF THE NITROGEN TRUCKS BEGAN DEVELOPING OPERATIONAL PROBLEMS AND, SHORTLYAFTER 18:00 HAD TO BE SHUT DOWN BY UCISCO.  AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME, PRESSUREMEASUREMENT DEVICES INDICATED A PRESSURE DROP WHICH WAS LOGICALLY ASSOCIATEDWITH A REDUCTION IN PUMPING CAPACITY.  THE REMAINING PUMP TRUCK CONTINUED OPERATING AND THE TANK AT FREEMAN CONTINUED RECEIVING OIL FROM THE LINE AT A REDUCED RATE.  THE DISABLED PUMP TRUCK WAS REPAIRED AND PUT BACK ON LINE ABOUT 19:00.  THE MAXIMUM PRESSURE AT THE LOCATION OF THE NITROGEN TRUCKS UP UNTIL THE SHUT DOWN OF THE FIRST TRUCK WAS 570 PSI.  AFTER SHUT DOWN OF THE FIRST TRUCK PRESSURE DROPPED BELOW 300 PSI. FOLLOWING THE RETURN OF THE SECOND PUMP TRUCK, PRESSURE STAYED LOW LONGER THAN EXPECTED, WHICH APPEARED TO INDICATE THE LINE WAS AGAIN BEING PACKED.  COMMUNICATIONS WITH APL'S TULSA CONTROL CENTER WERE HEIGHTENED IN A EFFORT TO MORE COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE REASONS WHY PURGE LINE PRESSURE WAS FAILING TO RETURN TO PRE-SHUTDOWN LEVELS.  FLOW RATE AND PRESSURE INFORMATION WAS REQUESTED FROM THE TULSA CONTROL CENTER AT APPROXIMATELY 20:00.  APL WAS IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THIS DATA WHEN A CALL WAS RECEIVED AT 20:15 FROM A THIRD PARTY, NOTIFYING APL OF A POSSIBLE LEAK.  APL IMMEDIATELY DIRECTED THE CESSATION OF NITORGEN PUMPING, AND AT ABOUT 20:20.  APL PERSONNEL LEFT LAPLATA TO LOCATE THE SUSPECTED LEAK.  APL PERSONNEL ARRIVED IN ELMER, CONFIRMED THE ODOR, BUT COULD FIND NO LEAK.  AT ABOUT 21:30, AFTER SEARCHING THE AREA, APL PERSONNEL ACTUALLY FOUND THE LEAK NEAR ETHEL INA FARM FIELD 1/2 MILE AWAY FROM THE NEAREST ROAD.  APL PERSONNEL PROCEEDED TO ANSPACH JUNCTION TO CLOSE THE NEAREST UPSTREAM VALVE.  THE ACTUAL CAUSE OF THIS PIPE FAILURE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION.  THE ACTUAL TIME OF RUPTURE IS NOT KNOWN, BUT IS BELEIVED TO HAVE BEEN BETWEEN 18:00 AND 20:00, NOVEMBER 5, 1990."

BY 1628 HOURS OIL HAD BEGUN TO LEAK FROM THE TANK INTO THE TANK VAULT, BUT OPERATIONS PERSONNEL HAD ALREADY CONSTRUCTED DIKES AND BEGAN PICKING UP THE LEAKAGE WITH A VACUUM TRUCK.  THE LEAK FIRST APPEARED FLOWING INTO THECONCRETE VAULT FORM THE 48-INCH BOTTOM FILL NOZZLE ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE TANK.  INITIALLY, THE LEAKAGE RATE WAS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT FIVE GALLONS PER MINUTE, BUT WAS REDUCED TO A TRICKLE WHEN THE OIL HEAD IN THE TANK HAD BEEN LOWERED TO THE MINIMUM PUMPING LEVEL.  THE ORIGINAL TANK LEVEL OF 8 FEET WAS REDUCED TO .39 FEET BY 1830 HOURS.  AT THE PRESENT TIME, THE 48-INCH VALVES TO THETANK ARE CLOSED, THE TANK IS PARTIALLY INERTED WITH NITROGEN AND THE EXTERNAL LEAKAGE FROM THE TANK HAS ESSENTAILLY STOPPED.

At1822p EST, while cutting away the casing with a torch, gasoline vaporsescaping from the pipeline ignited, causing a small fire.  This flame wasimmediately extinguished.  The pipeline was shut down, and the Greene CountySheriff's Dept. and the Eutaw Fire Dept. were notified at 1832p EST.  TheNational Response Center was notified (Report #96173) of the incident at 2018EST on Nov. 13, 1991.After securing the area, a pipe saw was then employed to complete the removalof the casing and expose the pipeline.  An inspection of the exposed pipelinerevealed the source of the leak to be a 1 1/4"" x 1/2"" hole.  Although thehole had not completely penetrated the pipe wall, the remaining segment hadapparently cracked allowing the product to escape.  Twenty-one gallons of gaswas lost from the pipeline, of which 20 were recovered.  The inspection alsorevealed a nearby 1 1/4"" deep buckle in the pipeline.Both of these defects were repaired by the installment of one, 5 ft., fullencirclement sleeve to the pipeline.The exact cause of the hole could not be determined by the investigation ofon-site personnel.

DRAIN DOWN OF THE PIPELINE WAS STARTED AT 16:55 MARCH 1ST WITH FINAL EVACUATION COMPLETELY BY VACUUM TRUCKS ON MARCH 2ND.  INSPECTION OF THE BLOCK VALVE WITH THE MANUFACTURER'S REPRESENTATIVE INDICATED THAT A STEM SEAL FAILURE WAS THE PROBABLE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.  IGNITION SOURCE OF THE FIRE HAD NOT BEEN DETERMINED.  THE VALVE WAS REPAIRED BY INSTALLING NEW INTERNAL PARTS AND REPLACING THE HAND WHEEL OPERATOR.  ON MARCH 3RD, PRIOR TO RESTARTING THE PIPELINE, THE LINE WAS SLOWLY REPRESSURED TO CHECK THE VALVE REPAIR.  A SMALL LEAK ORIGINATING FROM A FAILURE IN THE VALVE BODY WAS DISCOVERED.  IT WAS DECIDED TO REPAIR THE LINE BY TEMPORARILY REMOVING THE VALVE AND REPLACING IT WITH A PIECE OF PIPE TO RESUME OPERATION UNTIL A REPLACEMENT 28"" VALVE WAS LOCATED.  THIS PLAN WAS ALSO REVIEWED WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY, SOUTHWEST REGION, HOUSTON, TEXAS BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION.  NEARBY BLOCKVALVES AT MILEPOSTS 92.19 AND 96.0 ARE BEING UTILIZED UNTIL THE NEW VALVE ISINSTALLED.  DUE TO ABNORMAL RAINS AND TIME REQUIRED TO VAPOR FREE THE AREA FOR SAFE WELDING, REPAIRS WERE DELAYED UNTIL MARCH 7TH.  THE PIPELINE RESUMED FULL OPERATION AT 1:00 MARCH 8TH.  A REPLACEMNT VALVE ID SCHEDULED FOR INSTALLATION ON ABOUT APRIL 6, 1992.  SOIL REMEDIATION PLANS ARE BEING COORDINATED WITH TEXAS WATER COMMISSION."

THE FIRE WAS APPROXIMATELY 8 TO 10 FEET SOUTH OF THE TANK.  THE WIND WAS ACARRING THE HEAT AND FLAME AWAY FROM THE TANK INTO ADJACENT MANIFOLD AREA.  WPL EMPLOYEES FROM THE KANSAS CITY COMPLEX AND KANSAS CITY MAINTENANCE CREW, FOUGHT THE FIRE USING DRY CHEMICAL EXTINGUISHERS.  THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL IN KNOCKING THE FIRE DOWN BUT WERE UNABLE TO COMPLETELY EXTINGUISH IT WITH THE EQUIPMENT AVIALABLE.  A GASOLINE MIST CONTINUED TO SPRAY FROM THE PUMP AND WAS REIGNITED BY THE HOT PIPING IN THEMANIFOLD AREA.  THE KANSAS CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED ON SITE VERY QUICKLYAND EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE USING FOAM AND WATER.  IN ALL, THE FIRE LASTED APPROXIMATELY 17 MINUTES.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES.  DUE TO THE QUICK RESPONSE OFOUR EMPLOYEES AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, THE DAMAGE WAS KEPT TO A MININUM.  THERE WAS NO SPILL ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT AS ALL GASOLINE SPRAYING FROM THE PUMP WAS CONSUMED IN THE FIRE.  CAUSE:  THE FIRE WAS CAUSED BY A THRUST BEARING FAILURE ON THE BOOSTER PUMP MOTOR.  WHEN THE BEARING FAILED, THE MOTORDROPPED SLIGHTLY, ALLOWING GASOLINE TO SPRAY OUT FROM THE PUMP SEAL. THE BEARING FAILURE ALSO CREATED METAL TO METAL CONTACT BETWEEN THE SEAL COLLAR AND THE GLAND PLATE.  THIS WAS THE HEAT SOURCE WHICH CAUSED IGNITION.   DAMAGE:  THE 200 HP PUMP ANDMOTOR SUSTAINED SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE.  IN ADDITION, AN ADJACENT 200 HP VERTICAL CAN PUMP WAS SLIGHTLY DAMAGED.  THE FIRE DESTROYED SIX MOTOR OPERATORS MOUNTED ON GENERAL TWIN SEAL VALVES IN THE MANIFOLD AREA  MUCHOF THE CONDUIT AND WIRING FOR THESE OPERATORS AND FOR THE BOOSTER PUMPS WAS ALSO DESTROYED.  THE TOTAL DAMAGE IS ESTIMATED TO BE $50,000.

AT 1555 EST, THE GEORGIA ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION DIVISION WAS ADVISEDTHAT THE LEAK EXISTED.  THE PIPELINE WAS REPAIRED BY INSTALLING A FULL-ENCIRCLEMENT, WELDED SPLIT SLEEVE OVER THE HOLE.  COLOR PHOTOS WERE TAKEN OF THE ANOMALY AND FORWARDED TO AN INDEPENDENT METALLURGIST FOR ANALYSIS AND ALSO TO THE WASHINGTON, DC OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY.  A PRELIMINARY REPORT FROM THISMETALLURGIST, INDICATES THAT THE LEAK RESULTED FROM A SEVERE ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE FROM THE PIPELINE PROBABLY AS THE RESULT OF A LIGHTNING STRIKE.  CLEAN-UP ACTIVITIES BEGAN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THE LEAK AND INCLUDE THE PLACEMENT OF ABSORBENT BOOMS AND PADS IN A NEARBY CREEK WHERE FREE PRODUCT WAS DISCOVERED.  TEST HOLES HAVE BEEN DRILLED INTO THE WATER TABLE TODETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE CONTAMINATION PRESENT.  THROUGH 5/10/93, APPROXIMATELY 11 BARRELS OF GASOLINE HAVE BEEN RECOVERED AND RETURNED TO THE SYSTEM.CLEAN-UP AND SOIL REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES ARE CONTINUING.  MARCH 9, 1994:COLONIAL HAS ROUTINELY MONITORED AND PERIODICALLY PICED UP PRODUCT AT ARECOVERY TRENCH INSTALLED AT THIS LEAK SITE. AN APPROXIMATE TOTAL OF 62BARRELS HAS BEEN RECOVERED.  ON FEBRUARY 11, 1994, AND EMPLOYEE VISITED THESITE AFTER HEAVY RAINS AND NOTED THAT TRACES OF GASOLINE HAD RISEN TO THEGROUND SURFACE, AND A SLIGHT SHEEN GAD MIGRATED TO THE NEARBY CREEK.  BECAUSETHE PRODUCT SHEEN WAS VISIBLE ON THEIS SMALL STREAM, COLONIAL NOTIFIED THENATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (REPORT NO.221308).  WHILE ONLY ONE GALLON OFGASOLINE WAS RECOVERED BY THE APPLICATION OF ABSORBANT PADS AT THE VISIT TOTHE SITE, COLONIAL'S ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENT HAS CONTINUED TO TEST THE LEVELSOF CONTAMINATION AND NOW EXPECTS THAT AN UNDERTERMINED AMOUNT OFCONTAMINATION AND SOME PRODUCT STILL EXISTS IN THE GROUND.

THE HOEEXCAVATED NEAR AND ABOVE THE SANJAC LINE. HOWEVER, THE SANJAC LINE WAS NOT EXPOSED DURING THIS OPERATION. AN EXAMINATION OF THE SANJAC PIPELINE AFTER THERUPTURE FOUND THE LINE HAD SEVERE MECHANICAL DAMAGE THAT HAD GOUGED AND DENTED THE PIPE. ALTHOUGH, IT CAN NOT BE DETERMINED EXACTLY WHEN THE DAMAGE OCCURRED, IT IS FELT THAT THIS DAMAGE WAS THE RESULT OF THE HOE HITTING THE PIPELINE DURING THE EXCAVATION ON JANUARY 27, 1994. MECHANICAL DAMAGE WAS FOUND IN TWO OTHER AREAS NEAR THE RUPTURE POINT. THE CONTRACTOR HAS TOLD UPRC THAT THEHOE OPERATOR DID NOT EXPOSED, UPRC AND PANOLA DID NOT KNOW THAT ANY DAMAGE HAD OCCURRED.

ABOUT 1:00 AM SATURDAY MORNING, JANUARY29, 1994 THE FLOW WAS RAISED TO 380 BPH. AT 4:25 AM ON THAT MORNING THE PIPELINE RUPTURED. IT IGNITED WITHIN MINUTES OF THE RUPTURE. THE LOCATION OF THE RUPTURE IS REMOTE AND THE SOURCE OF IGNITION SPARKS FROM ROCKS BEING THROWN AROUND. THE PRESSURE LOSS WAS IMMEDIATELY NOTICED BY THE SCADA SYSTEM. WITHIN 10 MINUTES THAT PIPELINE WAS SHUTDOWN. THE MANUAL VALVE AT THE EAST TEXAS PLANT, WHICH IS THE CLOSEST VALVE UPSTREAM OF THE RUPTURE WAS CLOSED AT APPROXIMATELY 4:54 AM. THE MANUAL VALVE ON THE PIPELINE IMMEDIATELY DOWNSTREAM OF THERUPTURE WAS CLOSED APPROXIMATELY 5:30 AM. THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE CAUSED SEVERAL GATHERING PIPELINES WHICH HAD ABOVEGROUND FACILITIES ADJACENT TO THE SANJAC LINE TO FAIL. THE POINTS OF FAILURE WERE THE INSULATING FLANGES WHERE THE INSULATING GASKETS MELTED. THE GAS AND LIQUID FROM THESE PIPELINES WERE ISOLATED AND THE CONTENTS OF THE PIPELINES WERE ALLOWED TO BURN OUT. THE FIRES WERE UNDER CONTROL BY 8:30 AM.

AFTER ISOLATING THE DAMAGED SEGMENT OF LINE, CPL WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE LOCAL EMERGECY RESPONDERS TO COORDINATE EMERGECY RESPONSE EFFORTS. THE EVACUATION OF 4 HOUSEHOLDS WERE NECESSARY TO MINIMIZE DANGER TO THE OCCUPANTS. DURING THEDAYLIGHT HOURS FOLLOWING THE RELEASE, THE PROPANE CLOUD WAS DISSIPATING RAPIDLY AND, THEREFORE, WAS BEING ALLOWED TO VENT. HOWEVER, AS EVENING APPROACHEDWEATHER CONDITIONS BEGAN TO CHANGE. IT WAS FEARED THAT THE PROPANE WOULD BEGIN POOLING AND POSSIBLY REACH AN ACCIDENTAL IGNITION SOURCE. FOR THIS REASON,IT WAS DECIDED TO INTENTIONALLY IGNITE THE VAPOR CLOUD ADJACENT TO THE DAMAGED PIPELINE. ALL NON-ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL WERE MOVED TO SHELTERING POSITIONS, WHILE CPL PERSONNEL, ALONG WITH THE PULASKI COUNTY SHERIFF MOVED INTO POSITION TO IGNITE THE VAPOR CLOUD. WHEN EVERYONE WAS SATISFIED THAT ALL POSSIBLE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS HAD BEEN TAKEN, FLARES WERE FIRED INTO THE CLOUD BY A CPL EMPLOYEE, IGNITING THE VAPOR CLOUD. STOPPLE EQUIPMENT WAS THEN MOVED IN AND INSTALLED TO REDUCE PRODUCT LOSS AND SHORTEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME REQUIRED TO FLARETHE EXISTING LINE FILL. WHEN LOCAL PERSONNEL WERE SATISFIED THAT THE LINE FILL HAD BEEN FLARED SUFFICIENTLY TO EFFECT REPLACEMENT OF THE DAMAGED SECTION SAFELY, WORK WAS BEGUN. THE DAMAGED SECTION OF LINE WAS REMOVED AND THE REPAIRED LINE WAS LOWERED TO A DEPTH OF 36 INCHES TO PREVENT FUTURE DAMAGED OF THIS TYPE. THE EXCAVATION REQUIRED THE USE OF ROCK BREAKING EQUIPMENT TO REACH THE 36 INCH DEPTH. THE SECOND LINE WAS ALSO LOWERED AS A PRECAUTION. UPON COMPLETION OF THESE REPAIRS, THE STOPPLE EQUIPMENT WAS ALSO REMOVED AND AFFECTED JOINT CUT OUT AND REPLACED. ROAD GRADER WAS BEING OPERATED BY STANLEY CHRISTMAN AN EMPLOYEE OF PULASKI COUNTY.

WHILE THE NOTIFICATIONS WERE TAKING PLACE EMERGENCY RESPONSE CREWS WERE DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION TO CLOSE THE MANUALLY OPERATED VALVES LOCATED ON EITHER SIDE OF THE RUPTURE SITE. THIS WAS DONE TO FURTHER ISOLATE THE DAMAGED SEGMENTOF LINE. UPON ARRIVAL AT THE SITE OF THE RUPTURE AND FIRE COMPANY PERSONNEL COORDINATED WITH LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE OFFICIALS TO ISOLATE THE AREAAND DISCUSS AVAILABLE OPTIONS FOR ADDRESSING THE SITUATION. AFTER ASSESSING THE SITUATION, THE RUPTURE WAS DETERMINED TO BE ON THE #1 WOOD RIVER 10"" LINE. BASEDON THIS ASSESSMENT, RESTRICTED OPERATIONS OF THE #2 LINE WERE RESUMED AT 04:50 HRS ON 7-22-94. OPERATING PRESSURES WERE HELD TO 50% OF THE OPERATING PRESSURE AT THE TIME OF THE RUPTURE ON THE #1 LINE. AFTER FURTHER DISCUSSING THE SITUATION, IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE SAFEST OPTION WOULD BE TO ALLOW THE REMAINING PROPANE IN THE #1 LINE TO BURN ITSELF OUT. TO SPEED THIS PROCESS, PROPANEWAS LOADED OUT OF THE #1 LINE AND INTO TRUCKS VIA A TOR FITTING AT THE UPSTREAM BLOCK VALVE SITE. APPROXIMATELY 300 BBLS. WERE LOADED BEFORE THE PRODUCT BEGAN GOING TO VAPOR, DUE TO DECREASING PRESSURE IN THE LINE. AS AN ADDITIONAL MEASURE TO REDUCE THE VOLUME OF PROPANE IN THE LINE, A PROCESS OF MONITOREDVENTING WAS THEN BEGUN AT BOTH THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM BLOCK VALVES. THIS PROCESS WAS ACCOMPLISHED VIA 2"" STACKS FABRICATED ON SITE. AT 10:14 H RS ON7-24-94, THE REMAINING PROPANE IN THE LINE WAS CONSUMED AND THE FLAME EXTINGUISHED ITSELF. AFTER ALLOWING THE AREA TO COOL, AND INSURING THAT THE AREA WAS SAFE TO BEGIN REPAIRS, THE RUPTURED LINE WAS EXCAVATED AND APPROXIMATELY 83FEET OF PIPE WAS REPLACED. UPON COMPLETING THESE REPAIRS AND RESUMING NORMALOPERATION OF THE #1 LINE, THE #2 LINE WAS EXCAVATED AND EXAMINED FOR DAMAGE.NO DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED BY CPL PERSONNEL, OR RALPH HANLIN, (DOT ONSITE INVESTIGATOR CENTRAL REGION). MR. HANLIN APPROVED RETURNING THE #2 LINE TO NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE AT THE TIME (APPROX. 21:30 HRS ON 7-24-94)."

The following is an account of the accident:At approximately 1600 hrs on 7/17/95 Explorer's air patrol pilot reported anarea of dead grass on the pipeline ROW near MP 22.7 on the Lake Charles,Louisiana to Pt Arthur, Texas 12"" pipeline.  The system was shut down andisolated.  Response crews were immediately dispatched to the site.  Atapproximately 1730 hrs Explorer personnel arrived and located a small amountof dark fuel oil in a pasture floating on water contained in a 12 ft. diameter mud puddle on a pipeline/power transmission line corridor.  The National Response Center and Louisiana State agencies were notified.  Because of the remote location and lack of roads, repair equipment had to be barged on the intracoastal waterway to the vicinity of the repair site.  Repair/cleanup crews and equipment were moved in and began cleanup and excavation operations at 1200 hrs on 7/18/95.  Approximately one barrel of fuel oil was recovered from the surface of the mud puddle with sorbent pads.  A pinhole leak was discoveredand temporary repairs were made by installing a Plidco Split Sleeve.  The pipeline was returned to normal operations at 1615 hrs on 7/19/95.  Permanent repairs were completed on 8/1/95 by welding three full encirclement sleeves over localized corrosion pits.  Following sampling and testing of the contaminated soil, it was determined that the contaminated soil had to be removed and barged/trucked to a licensed industrial land fill site.  Clean fill dirt was barged into the site to replace the removed soil."

THE VAULT WAS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FEED DEEP. THE OIL WAS APPROXIMATELY 18"" DEEP INTHE 36"" DIAMETER VAULT. THE PIPELINE PRESSURE WAS REDUCED FROM APPROXIMATELY650 PSI TO APPROXIMATELY 325 PSI BY REDUCING THROUGHOUT AND ADJUSTING PUMP STATION SUCTION/DISCHARGE PRESSURES. THE SECOND BYPASS VALVE ON CHECK VALVE 92WAS CLOSED IN CASE THE LEAK WAS BETWEEN THE TWO SERIES VALVES. EXCAVATION EQUIPMENT WAS BROUGHT IN AND REVEALED THAT A 1/2"" SCREWED PLUG LOCATED ON THE 6"" BYPASS PIPING WAS LOOSE AND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OIL LEAKAGE. A NEW PIPE PLUG WAS SCREWED INTO THE THREAD-O-LET AND THE BYPASS PIPING WAS PRESSURIZED. PIPELINE PRESSURE RESTRICTIONS WERE REMOVED AT THIS POINT AND THE BYPASS PIPINGWAS CLEANED FOR INSPECTION. EXAMINATION REVEALED FIVE RADIAL CRACKS IN THE THREAD-O-LET THAT THE PIPE PLUG WAS SCREWED INTO. THE BYPASS VALVE WAS CLOSED AND THE ENTIRE FLANGED BYPASS SPOOL WAS REPLACED. EXCAVATION CONTINUES TO REMOVE THE CONTAMINATED SOIL FROM THE PIPE DITCH. THE DITCH WAS ORIGINALLY CUT INTO SOLID BEDROCK IN THE AREA OF THE LEAK TO A DEPTH OF APPROXIMATELY 25 FEET. EXCAVATION IS VERY SLOW DUE TO THE DEPTH OF THE HOLE, CRUDE OIL VAPOR AND THE NEED TO HAD EXCAVATE AROUND THE OPERATING PIPELINE. DURING EXCAVATION ACTIVITIES ON APRIL 27, 1996, A BACKHOE SCRAPED AGAINST THE BEDROCK AND  AUSED A SPARK TO IGNITE THE CR5UDE VAPOR IN THE DITCH. THE OPERATOR IMMEDIATELY EXTINGUISHED THE BURNING SOIL BY SMOTHERING THE FIRE WITH A BUCKET FULL OF EXCAVATED MATERIAL. THERE WERE NO INJURIES AND NO DAMAGE TO THE PIPELINE OR EXCAVATION EQUIPMENT. AS OF THIS DATE, APPROXIMATELY 250 FEET OF MAIN LINE PIPE HAS BEEN EXCAVATED AND BACKFILLED. A TOTAL OF 8,442 GALLONS OF OIL AND WATER HAS BEEN RECOVERED (2,200 GALLONS CRUDE OIL). APPROXIMATELY 3,200 CUBIC YARDSO F CONTAMINATED SOIL HAS BEEN EXCAVATED. APPROXIMATELY 1,500 CUBIC YARDS HAS BEENCHARACTERIZED AS HEAVILY CONTAMINATED WITH REMAINDER BEING LIGHTLY CONTAMINATED. THE SOUTHERN EXTREMITY OF CONTAMINATED SOILS WAS FOUND ON MAY 14TH. HOWEVER, EXCAVATION IS NOT COMPLETE SINCE THE NORTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE CONTAMINATED SOIL HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED. A TEST HOLE TO EXPOSE THE PIPE 200 FEET NORTH (DOWNHILL) FROM THE VALVE SHOWED NO EVIDENCE OF CRUDE OIL OR BENZENE VAPORS. THIS WOULD INDICATE THAT EXCAVATION IS MORE THAN 50% COMPLETE. THE PIPE DITCH IS IN SOLID BEDROCK AND IS QUITE IMPENETRABLE. NO EVIDENCE HAS BEEN FOUNDTHAT INDICATES THE CRUDE OIL IS MIGRATING OUT OF THE PIPE TRENCH. A SUPPLEMENTAL ACCIDENT REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN FINAL SPILL ESTIMATES ARE COMPLETE. THIS ACCIDENT WAS REPORTED BY TELEPHONE ON APRIL 20, 1996. IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THE SPILL VOLUME AND REPAIRS WOULD EXCEED THE REPORTING LIMIT. THE SMALL FIRE ON APRIL 27TH WAS REPORTED TO THE LOCAL DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION REPRESENTATIVE ONLY. THE CAUSE OF THE SPILL APPEARS TO BE CAUSED BY THE INADEQUATEDESIGN AND INSTALLATION OF A VALVE ACTUATOR VAULT IN 1982 THAT WAS BEARING ON THE 1/2"" THREADED PIPE PLUG. THE VAULT CAUSED THE THREAD-O-LET TO CRACK ANDLEAK. THERE ARE 40 BELOW GRADE MAINLINE CHECK VALVES IN THE SYSTEM.

ADDITIONALLY, QUARTERLY MAINTENANCE RECORDS INDICATE THAT THE EQUIPMENT WAS ALSO FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY DURING THE PREVIOUS TEST CONDUCTED IN THE FIRST QUARTER.

AT 0905 HOURS, THE MAINTENANCE CREW PROBED THE LINE A SECOND TIME IN THE SAME AREA THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY TESTED AND DETECTED A PRODUCT ODOR.  A BACKHOE WAS BROUGHT TO THE SITE AT AT 1000 HOURS THE LEAK WAS CONFIRMED.  THE BACKHOE CONTINUED TO DIG IN THE AREA UNTIL THE LEAK WAS LOCATED AND CLAMPED OFF AT APPROX. 1130 HOURS.  THE QUARTER INCH HOLE IN THE 6 OCLOCK POSITION OF THEPIPE WAS IDENTIFIED AS INTERNAL CORROSION.  AN ULTRASONIC EXAMINATION IN THE AREA AROUND THE LEAK INDICATED THAT THIS WAS AN ISOLATED CONDITION. IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON, SAND WAS BROUGHT IN TO LINE THE DITCH TO ISOLATE THE HYDROCARBON VAPORS IN ORDER THAT A PATCH COULD BE SAFELY WELDED ON THE LINE.THIS WAS COMPLETED AT 1430 HOURS.  REMEDIATION OF THE SITE CONTINUED BY DIGGING TRENCHES AND USING VACUUM TRUCKS AND SKIMMERS TO PICK UP THE FREE PRODUCT.  IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE PLUME, DRILLING RIGS WERE BROUGHT IN TO DRILL 28 MONITORING WELLS.  FROM THE INFORMATION OF FREE PRODUCT STANDING IN EACH WELL, AS WELL AS FROM REVIEWING PAST RECORDS REGARDING TANK 1310 OPERATION, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT 30,000 BARRELS HAD LEAKED OUT OF THE LINE OVER A 2.5 YEAR PERIOD.  THE REMEDIATION OF THIS SITE IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS AND THE ESTIMATED TOTAL PROPERTY DAMAGE RECORDED EARLIER IN THIS REPORT REFLECTS ANTICIPATED COSTS FOR THE ENTIRE REMEDIATION PERIOD.  AFTER THE VACUUM TRUCKS AND SKIMMERS BECOME INEFFECTIVE, IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT AN AIR SPARGING/SOIL VAPOR EXTRACTION SYSTEM WILL BE INSTALLED FOR THE DURATION OF THE REMEDIATION PERIOD."

THE CASING WAS EXCAVATED AND A SMALL AMOUNT OF PRODUCT (LESS THAN ONE GALLON) WAS OBSERVED COMING FROM THE CASING.  THE DECISION WAS MADE TO REPLACE THE CASED CROSSING AND A NEW PIPELINE WAS INSTALLED UNDER THE HIGHWAY BY HORIZONTAL DIRECTIONAL DRILLING.  APPROXIMATELY 294 FEET OF 0.500"" WALL THICKNESS, X-52 PIPE AND 10 FEET OF 0.375 WALL THICKNESS, X-52 PIPE WAS INSTALLED.

THE SECTION OF PIPE WAS SHIPPED TO KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES FOR ANALYSIS.  THE REPORT FROM KIEFNER STATED THAT THE ANOMALY APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE ELECTRICAL ARCING BETWEEN THE PIPELINE AND CASING.  APPARENTLY AN ELECTRICAL POWER LINE LOCATED IMMEDIATELY ABOVE THE PIPELINE CASING VENT WAS DOWNED AND MADE CONTACT WITH THE VENT PIPE, WHICH PROVIDED AN ELECTRICAL PATH FOR THE FAULT CURRENT TO TRAVEL FROM THE POWER LINE TO THE CASING, FROM WHERE THE CURRENT ARCED TO THE CARRIER PIPE.  THE PRESENCE OF A LARGE HOLE MELTED IN THE CASING VENT PIPE AND AN APPARENT SPLICE IN THE OVERHEAD POWER LINE IMMEDIATELY ABOVE THE PIPELINE FURTHER SUPPORTS KIEFNERS CONCLUSIONS.

THE ANALYSIS WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPONENTS. EXTERNAL FORCES, INTERNAL FORCES AND MATERIAL DEFECTS.  INTERNAL FORCES AND MATERIAL DEFECTS DID NOT LEAD US TO ROOT CAUSES.  ALL THE ROOT CAUSES CAME FROM EXTERNAL FORCES.  THE TEAM DETERMINED THAT THE ACCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY EXCESSIVE STRESS CREATED BY WATER CURRENT PASSING OVER THE SPANNING PIPE.  THE PIPE WAS SPANNING BECAUSE OUR INSPECTION CYCLE FREQUENCY WAS TOO LONG FOR THIS SPECIFIC LOCATION.  HIGHER THAN NORMAL TIDAL CURRENTS IN THIS AREA CAUSED LINE-LONG SPANNING PROBLEMS FASTER THAN NORMAL.  ANOTHER EXTERNAL FORCE THAT CONCERNED THE TEAM IS THIRD PARTY DAMAGE.  WE COULD NOT CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION ON THIS CAUSE DUE TO LACK OF DATA FROM A CALIPER SMART PIG INSPECTION.  TEPCOS CREWS AND CONTRACTORS WORKING IN THE VICINITY OF OUR PIPELINE DURING THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT IS A VERY COINCIDENTAL CIRCUMSTANCE THAT NEEDS DATA DRIVEN INVESTIGATION.

A PHILLIPS EMPLOYEE WAS DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION TO EVALUATE THE LEAK.  EMPLOYEE ARRIVED AT 12:15 AM AND CONFIRMED THERE WAS A LEAK CAUSING A VAPOR CLOUD ON PHILLIPS PIPELINE RIGHT OF WAY.  PHILLIPS EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL WERE SENT TO THE LOCATION.  THE BRAZORIA COUNTY SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT WAS CONTACTED AND DISPATCHED AN OFFICER TO THE SITE.  PHILLIPS PERSONNEL ENTERED THE SUSPECTED LEAK AREA WITH HYDROCARBON DETECTOR AND DETERMINED THE LIMITS OF VAPOR CLOUD (USING A 10% LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT CRITERIA) WAS APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET IN RADIUS AT GROUND LEVEL.  PUBLIC EVACUATION AND ROADBLOCKS WERE NOT REQUIRED SINCE THERE WERE NO HOUSES OR PUBLIC ROADS IN THE VICINITY.  SINCE THERE WERE MULTIPLE LINES IN THIS RIGHT OF WAY INITIAL EFFORTS WERE FOCUSED ON IDENTIFYING THE CORRECT LINE AND SHUTTING DOWN ANY POTENTIAL SUSPECTS.  A TOTAL OF FOUR LINES WERE SHUTDOWN DURING THE PROCESS INCLUDING THE BUTANE-BUTYLENE MIX PIPELINE.  A SAMPLE OF THE VAPOR WAS TAKEN AND ANALYZED AT THE SWEENY COMPLEX LABORATORY WHICH CONFIRMED THE LEAKING LINE TO BE THE BUTANE-BUTYLENE MIX PIPELINE.  THE BUTANE-BUTYLENE MIX PIPELINE TAKES PRODUCT FROM THE SWEENY COMPLEX TO UNDERGROUND STORAGE AT THE CLEMENS TERMINAL STORAGE FACILITY.  THE BUTANE-BUTYLENE MIX PIPELINE WAS DEPRESSURIZED TO A SPHERE STORAGE TANK AT THE SWEENY COMPLEX AT APPROXIMATELY 430AM.  THIS REDUCED THE PIPELINE PRESSURE FROM APPROXIMATELY 650 PSIG DOWN TO 50 PSIG.  AT 1150 AM THE CLEMENS TERMINAL LAUNCHED A PIG TO DISPLACE THE BUTANE-BUTYLENE MIX PIPELINE WITH WATER TO SWEENY COMPLEX.  IT IS ESTIMATED THE PIG PASSED THE LEAK LOCATION AT 1018PM APRIL 21, 2000.  AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT THE SKY WAS CLEAR AND THERE WAS NO WIND.  SCATTERED FOG WAS BEGINNING TO FORM ALONG THE PIPELINE RIGHT OF WAY.  THE LEAK WAS APPROXIMATELY 2 TO 3 INCHES FROM A WELD AT CLOCK LOCATION 3:30.  EXTERNAL CORROSION PITS WERE VISIBLE AT THE LEAK.  ONE AT THE 330 POSITION AND ONE AT APPROXIMATELY 3:50 POSITION.  WHEN UNCOVERING THE LEAK THERE WAS A THIN WHITE PLASTIC SHEET LOOSELY WRAPPED AROUND THE WELD AREA.  COATING MATERIAL IN THE AREA DIRECTLY AROUND THE WELD WAS NOT VISIBLE WHEN THE PLASTIC WAS REMOVED.  CATHODIC PROTECTION READINGS AT THE WELD WERE 1724 MV WHICH IS ABOVE THE -850MV CRITERIA USED ON THIS PIPELINE.  THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE LEAK IS THAT THE COMBINATION OF BAD COATING AND WATER TRAPPED UNDER THE PLASTIC RESULTED IN A CORROSION CELL.  THE WELDS APPROXIMATELY 60 FEET EAST AND WEST OF THE LEAK WERE ALSO UNCOVERED FOR INSPECTION.  THE COATING AND WRAP WERE FOUND TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION.  THE COATING WAS REMOVED AND NO INDICATION OF WATER OR EXTERNAL CORROSION WAS EVIDENT AT THESE TWO LOCATIONS.  ULTRASONIC READING ON THE PIPE INDICATED FULL WALL THICKNESS.

ON DECEMBER 19, 2000, CONOCO PIPE LINE (CPL) OIL MOVEMENTS GROUP LOCATED IN HOUSTON TEXAS, RECEIVED AN ALARM THAT INDICATED A LOW SUCTION CONDITION EXISTED AT ONE OF THE PUMP STATIONS ON THE KANSAS CITY PIPE LINE (KCPL) SYSTEM. AFTER EXAMINING THE CONTROL PARAMETERS OF TH3E SYSTEM, THE OPERATIONS COORDINATOR ATTEMPTED TO RESET THE ALARM AND RESTART THE UNIT. UNABLE TO RESTART THE UNIT, THE OPERATIONS COORDINATOR STARTED THE BACK-UP UNIT. WHEN THE CONTROL PARAMETERS FAILED TO INDICATE THE NECESSARY CHANGES CONSISTENT WITH OPERATING THE UNIT, THE LINE WAS IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN AND ISOLATED (THE ISOLATION OPERATION WAS COMPLETE BY 06:45 HRS. DECEMBER 19, 2000). SIMULTANEOUSLY TO THE ISOLATION PROCESS, EMERGENCY PERSONNEL WERE NOTIFIED OF THE POTENTIAL LINE FAILURE AND DISPATCHED TO LOCATE THE POSSIBLE RELEASE. WHILE RESPONSE PERSONNEL WERE ATTEMPTING TO LOCATE THE POSSIBLE RELEASE, THE CPL OIL MOVEMENTS GROUP RECEIVED AN EMERGENCY PHONE CALL AT 07:05 HRS. FROM A PASSERBY NEAR EUREKA, KS. THE CALLER REPORTED GASOLINE RUNNING IN A BARROW DITCH ALONG COUNTY RD 14 IN GREENWOOD COUNTY, KS. RESPONSE PERSONNEL WERE IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO THE AREA, WHERE THEY FURTHER ISOLATED THE FAILURE POINT, VIA MANUALLY OPERATED BLOCK VALVES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE RELEASE. CONTAINMENT AND RECOVERY OPERATIONS WERE UNDERWAY BY 08:15.THE INITIAL AGENCY NOTIFICATIONS TO THE NRC AND KDHE WERE MADE AT 09:20 HRS. AND 09:30 HRS. ON DECEMBER 19TH, 2000 RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, THE CENTRAL REGION OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY WAS NOTIFIED AS A COURTESY AT 09:35 HRS ON THAT SAME DAY. THE RELEASE VOLUME REPORTED DURING THESE INITIAL AGENCY NOTIFICATIONS, WAS 50 TO 100BBLS. AS THE RECOVERY PROCESS PROGRESSED, IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT MORE PRODUCT HAD BEEN RELEASED THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED. THIS WAS CONFIRMED BY THE QUANTITY OF PRODUCT BEING RECOVERED, AS WELL AS BY THE VOLUMES REQUIRED TO REPACK THE PIPELINE SYSTEM AFTER REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED. THE INITIAL ESTIMATE OF RELEASE PRODUCT WAS BASED SOLELY ON THE FIRST RESPONDERS VISUAL RECONNAISSANCE OF THE RELEASE SITE. UNFORTUNATELY THE RELEASE OCCURED DURING A HEAVY SNOWFALL, AND IT HAS BECOME APPARENT THAT THE SNOWFALL HAMPERED THE FIRST RESPONDERS ABILITY TO SEE PRODUCT THAT HAD MIGRATED BENEATH THE SNOW. THE RELEASE VOLUME IS NOW ESTIMATED AT 2090 BBLS. AN ADDITIONAL CALL WAS MADE TO THE CENTRAL REGION OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY ON JANUARY 3, 2001 @ 09:45 TO UPDATE THEM AS TO THE CURRENT ESTIMATED VOLUME FOR THE RELEASE. ADDITIONALLY, THIS INFORMATION WAS PASSED ON TO THE KDHE. WITH REGARD TO THE FAILURE, A FULL RCFA IS UNDERWAY. HOWEVER, PRELIMINARY RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED DUE TO STRESS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HEAT AFFECTED ZONE OF AN OLD PATCH TYPE REPAIR (THE PATCH WAS LOCATED IN AN UNDER-BEND AT A ROAD CROSSING). THE PATCH WAS APPROXIMATELY 12"" LONG AND 8"" WIDE AND WAS INSTALLED PRIOR TO CPL OPERATING THE PIPELINE SYSTEM. WITH REGARD TO THE REPAIR, CPL MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL REPLACED APPROXIMATELY 180 FEET OF 10"" PIPE. THIS FOOTAGE WAS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE TIE IN LOCATIONS WERE A SUFFICIENTLY SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE AREA OF IMPACTED SOIL."

THE SHEEN WAS A VERY WHITE MILKY COLOR, 2 MILES LONG X 1/2 MILE WIDE STREAMERS, 1/4 OF THE AREA WAS SHEEN. IT WAS SUSPECTED THAT THE GAS PIPELINE WAS LEAKING DUE TO THE COLOR, SO NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO THE VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE NRC (REPORT #555851). THE GAS LINE WAS SHUT IN, FILLED WITH FILTERED WATER AND HYDROTESTED TO 600+PSIG, WHICH PROVED THE GAS LINE TO BE INTACT. THE SHEEN DISAPPEARED DUE TO TIDES. THE OIL PIPELINE WAS NEXT SHUT IN TO HYDROTEST TO PROVE OR DISPROVE IF IT HAD A LEAK. A POLY PIG WAS SHIPPED AHEAD OF THE FILTERED WATER, DISPLACING THE OIL, BUT A GOOD HYDROTEST COULD NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED. IT WAS SUSPECTED THAT THE PRESSURE FLUCTUATION COULD HAVE BEEN DUE TO RESIDUAL OIL/GAS REMAINING IN THE PIPELINE AND COMPRESSING OR DUE TO TEMPERATURE VARIATION. A CUP PIG WAS NEXT SHIPPED TO ENSURE THAT NO OIL REMAINED IN THE PIPELINE. THE SECOND HYDROTEST ATTEMPT INDICATED THAT THE OIL LINE HAD A LEAK. DUE TO THE BLACKWATER NATURE OF THE COOK INLET WATERS, GAS WAS THEN USED TO DISPLACE THE WATER TO ALLOW DIVERS TO FIND THE LEAK LOCATION BY FOLLOWING THE BUBBLES. AFTER SERVERAL DIVES, THE DIVERS FOUND A 1/4 INCH HOLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPELINE. OTHER THAN THE INITIAL SHEEN OBSERVED BY THE PILOT, NO OTHER SPILL INDICATIONS WERE OBSERVED. DIVING CEASED DUE TO DANGER FROM PAN ICE IN THE INLET TO THE DIVE BOAT AND DIVERS. AT THE PRESENT, GAS PRESSURE IS BEING MAINTAINED ON THE LINE TO MINIMIZE WATER INTRUSION INTO THE PIPELINE AND TO PREVENT FREEZE-UP AT THE ONSHORE CROSSING. DIVING INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE MODE OF FAILURE WILL RESUME WHEN THE ICE IS OUT OF THE INLET."

AT 7:00 AM, PATRICK ARMSTRONG AND BRIAN BURNS ARRIVED ON SITE AND ASSUMED THE ROLES OF INCIDENT COMMANDER AND SAFETY OFFICER, RESPECTIVELY. THE SITUATION WAS SIZED UP AND A DECISION WAS MADE TO MOBILIZE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO WORK ON THE CLEANUP. A CREW FROM HERTAGE ENVIRONMENTAL WAS MOBILIZED FROM LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY. AT 1:00 PM, ADDITIONAL OVERFLOW DAMS WERE INSTALLED IN THE DRAINAGE DITCH ALONG DICKEY POND ROAD, DOWNSTREAM OF THE AFFECTED AREA, TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER MIGRATION OF OIL IN THE EVENT OF RAIN. BY 5:15 PM ( MAY 3), AFTER 12 HOURS OF EXCAVATION IN THE MANIFOLD AREA, THE STRAINER WAS LIFTED OUT OF THE MANIFOLD BY CRANE, AND WAS EXAMINED TO DETERMINE THE LOCATION OF THE FAILURE. AT THAT TIME, IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THERE IS A 1/4"" BY 1"" HOLE IN THE 2"" DRAIN LINE AT A POINT JUST BELOW THE WELD THAT FASTENS THE DRAIN LINE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STRAINER. A DECISION WAS MADE TO TEMPORARILY REPLACE THE STRAINER WITH A 26"" FLANGED SPOOL PIECE. RECOVERY CONTINUED IN THE MANIFOLD DURING THE DAY AND ANOTHER 30 BARRELS OF OIL AND WATER IS COVERED. AT 5:30 PM (MAY 3), THE HERITAGE ENVIRONMENTAL CREW ARRIVED AND BEGAN CLEANUP OF THE OFFSITE AREA AND EXCAVATION OF THE DRAINAGE DITCH.

THE SPILL WAS A RESULT OF OVERFILLING AN 80,000 BBL. TRANSMIX TANK, T-421. BACKGROUND: THE OPERATOR ON SHIFT WAS RECEIVING TMIX FROM MARATHON PIPELINE INTO TANK 421. THAT RECEIPT WAS FOLLOWED BY A RECEIPT OF TMIX FROM EXPLORER PIPELINE THAT ALSO WENT INTO TANK 421. ADDITIONALLY, THAT RECEIPT WAS FOLLOWED BY A DELIVERY FROM EXPLORER PIPELINE OF RFG GASOLINE INTO TANK 411. DUE TO A VALVE BEING TEMPORARILY OUT OF SERVICE FOR MAINTENANCE IN THE EXPLORER MAINIFOLD, AN ALTERNATE VALVE LINE UP WAS REQUIRED TO RECEIVE RFG INTO TANK 411. THE ALTERNATE VALVE LINE UP REQUIRED THE UTILIZATION OF THE OIL SIDE OF THE EXPLORER MANIFOLD VIA THE TANK 410 RECEIPT LINE. THIS PARTICULAR VALVE LINE UP PROVIDES A CONNECTION TO THE TANK 421 RECEIPT LINE VIA THE CPL MAINFOLD. (SIMILAR LINE UPS HAVE BEEN USED ON PAST RECEIPTS WITH NO PROBLEMS) WHEN THIS OUT OF ORDINARY LINE UP WAS EXECUTED, VALVE TM 407 WAS IN THE OPEN POSITION. THIS VALVE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED TO PREVENT RFG FROM CROSSING OVER FROM THE TANK 410 RECEIPT LINE TO THE TANK 421 RECEIPT LINE, WHICH IS NORMALLY LINED UP FOR PUMPING THE CPL SUMP. VALVE TM 407 WAS NOT LISTED ON THE VALVE LINE-UP SHEETS. BECAUSE THIS VALVE (NOT LISTED ON THE VALVE LINE UP SHEET) WAS OPEN, RFG GASOLINE WAS ALLOWED TO STRIP INTO TANK 421. CONSEQUENTLY, THE HIGH LEVEL ALARM FOR TANK 421 ACTIVATED AT APPROXIMATELY 04:24 HRS. AS A RESULT OF THIS ALARM, THE OPERATOR ON DUTY CLIMBED AND GAUGED TANK 421 TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE ALARM. THE OPERATOR ASSUMED THAT THE ALARM WAS THE RESULT OF THE ORIGINAL DELIVERY INTO TANK 421, AS THE RECEIPT VALVE FOR THIS TANK HAD BEEN CLOSED AT THE MANIFOLD. THE OPERATOR TOOK NO FURTHER ACTION UNTIL OBSERVING THE TANK IN AN OVERFILL CONDITION. UPON FINDING THE TANK IN AN OVERFILL CONDITION, THE OPERATOR NOW ASSISTED BY THE FACILITY MANAGER, LOCATED AND CLOSED VALVE TM 407 ISOLATING TANK 421 FROM THE INCOMING STREAM INTENDED TO FILL TANK 411. FORTUNATELY, THE RELEASED PRODUCT WAS CONTAINED INSIDE SECONDARY CONTAINMENT, AND WAS RECOVERED QUICKLY WITH THE USE OF A VACUUM TRUCK FROM THE LOCAL OSRO. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF RFG INADVERTENTLY DELIVERED INTO TANK 421 WAS 2905 BBLS. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TRANSMIX THAT SPILLED INTO THE DIKE WAS APPROXIMATELY 150 BBLS. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TRANSMIX RECOVERED WAS 122 BBLS.CONCLUSION: THE OPERATOR ON DUTY DID NOT FOLLOW PROPER PROCEDURE WHEN PREPARING FOR OR EXECUTING A VALVE LINE UP. THIS VIOLATION OF PROCEDURE RESULTED IN THE UNINTENTIONAL CONTINUED MOVEMENT OF PRODUCT INTO TANK 421, RESULTING IN THE OVERFILL CONDITION."

AT 2134 HOURS A COMMAND WAS SENT TO SHUTDOWN THE DELIVERY AT NEWARK MOTIVA.  FLOW INTO NEWARK SUNOCO ESTABLISHED.  AT 2136 HOURS, A HIGH-PRESSURE METER MANIFOLD ALARM FOR NEWARK SUNOCO WAS RECEIVED IN THE PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER.  THE SURGE RELIEF VALVE ACTIVATED AND BLED PRODUCT INTO THE TANK NUMBER 26, THE DESIGNATED SURGE RELIEF TANK.  THERE WAS AN AUTOMATIC FACILITY LOCKOUT AND THE PIPELINE SHUT DOWN.  A PIPELINE MECHANCIAL TECHINCIAN WAS DISPATCHED TO RESPOND TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE OF THE HIGH-PRESSURE METER MANIFOLD ALARM.  UPON ARRIVAL AT THE TERMINAL, THE PIPELINE TECHNICIAN FOUND GASOLINE SPRAYING FROM THE FLANGE ON THE DOWNSTREAM SIDE OF THE SURGE RELIEF VALVE.  THE SURGE RELIEF LINE HAD MOVED OFF THE SUPPORTS AND WAS SAGGING, APPARENTLY DUE TO HYDRAULIC HAMMER.  THE WEIGHT OF THE SAGGING LINE APPARENTLY CAUSED THE FLANGE TO SPREAD SLIGHTLY ALLOWING PRODUCT TO LEAK OUT.  THE PIPELINE TECHNICIAN ISOLATED THE LEAKING FLANGE AND NOTIFIED THE AREA MAINTENANCE SUPERVISOR PIPELINE MAINTENANCE CREWS AND CLEAN VENTURES (OSRO) WERE DISPATCHED TO THE SITE TO BEGIN CLEANUP.  TERMINAL PERSONNEL NOTIFIED THE NEWARK FIRE DEPARTMENT, THE NEW JERSEY DEP, AND NRC.  THE NEXT MORNING, USDOT/OPS-TRENTON OFFICE WAS NOTIFIED BY TELEPHONE.  AN ESTIMATED 2,000 GALLONS OF 87RF GASOLINE WAS RELEASED FROM THE FLANGE SPILLLING ONTO THE GROUND AROUND THE MANIFOLD WITH A SMALL QUANTITY ENTERING THE PASSAIC RIVER.  INVESTIGATION INTO THE INCIDENT SHOWS THAT THE DELIVERY CONTROL VALVE AT NEWARK SUNOCO HAD LOST ITS SET-POINT CONTROL LOOP DURING A POWER FAILURE THE NIGHT BEFORE DURING AN AREA-WIDE POWER OUTAGE.  AT THE TIME THE TERMINAL SWITCH WAS TO ME MADE, INFORMATION RECEIVED AT THE CONTROL CENTER INDICATED THAT THERE WAS AN OPEN PATH INTO THE NORMAL DELIVERY TANK.  WHEN DELIVERY WAS STARTED, INSTEAD OF RAMPING OPEN, THE CONTROL VALVE RAMPED CLOSED, BLOCKING IN THE LINE.  WITHOUT A VALUE FOR THE PLC SET-POINT CONTROL LOOP IN THE PROGRAM, THE SET-POINT CONTROL LOOP WENT TO A DEFAULT VALUE WHEN POWER WAS RESTORED TO THE FACILITY.  THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN CORRECTED TO INSURE CORRECT OPERATION OF THE CONTROL VALVE AT ALL TIMES, EVEN AFTER A POWER FAILURE.  AN ENGINEERING REVIEW OF THE RELIEF VALVE-PIPING CONFIGURATION IS UNDERWAY TO DETERMINE IF ANY MODIFICATIONS ARE NEEDED."

SWEENY COMPLEX EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT THE SITE AND BEGAN ASSISTING WITH THE EVACUATION OF THE PUBLIC AROUND THE SITE AND ESTABLISHING A SAFE PERIMETER AROUND THE AREA.  TWO ROADS AROUND THE AREA WERE BLOCKED BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL.  AN EMERGENCY COMMAND CENTER WAS ACTIVATED AT THE SWEENY COMPLEX AND ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE.  A LOCAL COMMUNITY CENTER WAS OPENED FOR DISPLACED RESIDENTS IN THE AREA AND HOTEL ROOMS WERE PROVIDED FOR THOSE AFFECTED.  SINCE THERE WERE MULTIPLE LINES IN THIS RIGHT OF WAY INITIAL EFFORTS WERE FOCUSED ON IDENTIFYING THE CORRECT LINE AND SHUTTING DOWN ANY POTENTIAL SUSPECTS.  A TOTAL OF 10 LINES WERE SHUTDOWN DURING THIS PROCESS INCLUDING THE #9 PROPYLENE PIPELINE.  ALL OF THESE PIPELINES TAKE PRODUCT FROM THE SWEENY COMPLEX TO UNDERGROUND STORAGE AT THE CLEMENS TERMINAL STORAGE FACILITY.  DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF VAPOR COMING FROM THE LEAK PERSONNEL WERE NOT ABLE TO SAFELY GET INTO THE IMMEDIATE AREA SURROUNDING THE LEAK TO TAKE A SAMPLE OR STOP THE LEAK AT THE SOURCE OF THE VAPOR.  THE PROPYLENE  LINE WAS SUSPECTED TO BE THE LEAKING LINE DUE TO THE PRESSURE DROP SEEN ON THE LINE.  ACTIONS WERE TAKEN TO ROUTE THE PROPYLENE TO EXISTING FLARES ON BOTH ENDS OF THE SYSTEM.  THE LINE DEPRESSURED TO THE ATMOSPHERE AT THE LEAK SITE AND TO THE FLARES AT BOTH UNTIL APPROXIMATELY 11:50PM ON OCTOBER 15, 2001 WHEN THE LINE EMPTIED OF VAPORS.  MONITORING OF THE AREA SURROUNDING THE LEAK CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.  THE ROADBLOCKS WERE RELEASED THE NEXT DAY. AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT THE SKY WAS CLEAR AND THERE WAS LIGHT WINDS.  THE WIND SHIFTED DURING THE NIGHT WHEN A FRONT CAME INTO THE AREA.  MONITORING OF VAPORS WAS ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY DURING THE NIGHT.  THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS PREVIOUS EXTERNAL DAMAGE TO THE PIPELINE.  THE LEAK AT THE SITE CONSISTED OF APPROXIMATELY A 12"" SPLIT WHICH STARTED AT A WELD AT CLOCK LOCATION OF 2:00.  EVIDENCE OF THE EXTERNAL DAMAGE WAS EVIDENT ON THE PIPE.  A DENT WAS PRESENT AT THE APPARENT START OF THE SPLIT AND SCRAP MARKS WERE FOUND ALONG THE TOP OF THE PIPE AND IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SPLIT.  A 4 FEET SECTION OF PIPE ALONG THE TOP OF THE PIPE WAS FLATTENED.  THE COATING ON THE PIPE WAS SCRAPED OFF WITH NO EVIDENCE OF HAVING BEEN REPAIRED.  THE PIPE UNDER THE COATING SHOWED LITTLE TO NO EVIDENCE OF CORROSION.  CATHODIC PROTECTION READINGS AT THE LEAK SITE WERE -1323 M V WHICH IS ABOVE THE -850MV CRITERIA USED ON THIS PIPELINE.  DIRECTLY UNDER THIS LINE WAS A CROSSING LINE WHICH HAD BEEN LAID IN 1997.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE OTHER CAUSES CONTRIBUTING TO THE RELEASE.  PRIOR TO THE START OF THE LEAK A LINE UP HAD OCCURRED WHICH PUT A HIGHER THAN NORMAL PRESSURE ON THE LINE.  ALTHOUGH THE PRESSURE WAS BELOW THE MOP OF THE LINE IT WAS ABOVE THE PRESSURE NORMALLY SEEN ON THE LINE.  AS A PRECAUTION THE LINES WHICH HAD BEEN CROSSED BY THE LINE LAID IN 1997 WERE EXCAVATED TO CHECK FOR DAMAGE.  THREE LINES IN THE CORRIDOR SHOWED COATING DAMAGE AT THE CROSSING LOCATION.  ONE UNREGULATED NITROGEN LINE SHOWED A SMALL GOUGE ON THE LINE WHICH WAS EVALUATED NOT TO COMPROMISE THE INTEGRITY OF THE LINE.  METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE FAILED PIPE IS BEING PERFORMED.  A 20 FEET SECTION OF THE LINE WAS INSTALLED AT THE LEAK LOCATION TO REPLACE TO FAILED PIPE.  PIPELINE WAS PUT BACK IN SERVICE ON OCTOBER 19, 2001. UPDATE 3-28-02 BASED ON HIS FINDINGS WE BELIEVE THAT THE OVERHELMING PHYSICAL EVIDENCE PRESENT ON THE PIPE SECTION WOULD MAKE FURTHER METALLURICAL ANALYSIS OF LIMITED VALUE.  THE PIPE SECTION HAD AND INWARD DENT PRESENT AT THE START OF THE SPLIT, SCRAP MARKS ALONG AND PAST THE SPLIT, AND APPROXIMATELY 4 FEET OF FLATTENED"
